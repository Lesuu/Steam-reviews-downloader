            "review": "Steam Review: Sengoku Dynasty\n\nPros:\n\nThe game is incredibly fun.\n\nThe world feels expansive and immersive.\n\nThe atmosphere is captivating.\n\nCombat is a highlight—intense and fluid, with mechanics reminiscent of Sekiro. (timing your parries, poise, etc)\n\n\nCons:\n\nPerformance Issues: The game runs poorly, even on decent hardware. With 16GB of RAM, 12GB of VRAM, and an i7-7700k, I get 12-25 FPS on average, regardless of settings, suggesting significant optimization issues.\n\nCrashes: The crashes are severe—my monitor loses input entirely, forcing a hard restart. These crashes have also corrupted my GPU driver twice, requiring me to use DDU and reinstall drivers. I will not these crashes seem to happen almost exclusively when fast travelling or loading a save game.\n\nSystem Stability: No other game I’ve played has caused such underlying issues with my PC that do not exist whilst playing other games.\n\nBugs: Frequent crashes have messed with game saves, leading to lost fast travel points and bugged out enemy or leader requirements in previously cleared areas.\n\n\nVerdict:\nThe core gameplay is fantastic, but the technical issues make it hard to recommend in its current state. Proceed with caution, as these issues may vary depending on your specific hardware. That said, the developers seem engaged with the community, so there’s hope for improvements in future updates. so i do recommend it i guess in terms of it's actual gameplay but just not right now.",

            "review": "Awesome game where you play as a peasant to begin with and then rank up to Feudal lord in 1600th century war torn Japan, you recruit other peasants and refugees to build a kingdom. They all have needs like food and water to begin with and then it gets more complicated over time. Paired with RPG survival elements like crafting and hunting, fighting and eating whatever you can find in the beginning. Combat is rather well thought out but is bugged from time to time and some controls like block with left alt is hard to get used to, but still feels like samurai battle when you learn to parry and dodge katana hits in full armour. Visually gorgeous and inviting but harsh FPS drops when stuff is happening. Hard to progress past a certain point when easier quests are done and you have crafted \"all new stuff\" and no longer get exp towards Dynasty Lvls. This game is a Grind and much is figuring out you villages and their needs, just like I enjoy my RPG's. Also one of the few games to take on feudal Japan like this and does it well. Need more games like this to flesh out the genre, instead of full on fantasy like Sekiro and Onimusha. People who get the need for named armors and weapons of this era and their niche in combat scenarios. Would enjoy some kind of raid mechanic in our villages and testing our defences and tactics, but the feeling of walking around in first or third person in our own Japanese villages is priceless :D One happy Otaku signing off!",

            "review": "So far, Im really enjoying the game. For what it has currently, the 12 hours I've put in the game so far has been fun. As with any city survival game, it's a slow burn at first, as you familiarize yourself with the open world, the various construction blueprints, recipes, etc. And, truth be told, it felt like a bit of a grind at first, as you bring in refugees and working hard to gather and satisfy the constant need for a steady food supply, water supply, and materials stored for supplying heat in your growing village. And, it's made even a bit frustrating as tool and weapon degradation exists in this game and, because wooden tools are what's available in the beginning, be prepared for a bit extra grinding as you often have to rebuild axes and hammers as you're foraging and building. But, again, this is only for maybe the first 4 hours or so , depending on how fast your are trying to go through the many quests you are presented with. With all that aside, I've been really enjoying building my villages. Having full control and freedom of choice of the layout of my villages is exactly what I want in games like this. I find the population system pretty good, as you find and bring in refugees that wonder into your village or that you come across out in the world and assign them a home and job. It's a good amount of micromanaging that doesn't feel overwhelming or too much. It does take much of the weight off me when my villagers are able to maintain a constant supply of food and water for the village. However, one issue I have regarding the villagers is with the game's pathing. Often, I find villagers walking in circles or hitting invisible walls when I assign them to a job and they are trying to get to the building to do the job. It's a minor annoyance and easily fixable with a patch. There is a good amount of character customization, as you and your villagers craft various attire items and armor. There's a decent amount of weapons and, of course, each weapon has stronger versions you can loot or craft as you gain access to stronger materials and ores. Speaking of weapons, the combat is surprisingly pretty good. It's got a slight jank to it but it's responsive and has a decent fun factor. The various weapons do provide a bit of strategy and allows you to somewhat tailor your play-style as different weapons offer different combat styles that utilize varying reach advantages (or disadvantages), different attacks with varying combos, varying attack speeds, etc. The dodging/blocking/parrying system is quite good as well. However, the AI isn't very smart or difficult, even when facing multiple enemies, as it's quite easy to recognize when an attack is coming and the enemy has no unblockable attacks. The AI also can suffer from the same pathing issues as they will often start walking away from me, even when I'm advancing towards them, attacking them from behind and they sometimes don't react. Again, it's an easy patch fix. I have yet to experience any raids on my villages, so I don't know how the game handles AI combat, as you can make villagers soldiers to guard, patrol, and protect your village. All in all, it's a pretty good package. I really look forward to other features the devs may be planning and developing to further the fun factor.",

            "review": "Buy it on sale. Thumbs down because marked as 1.0 but isn't complete.\n\nThis game definitely still feels like it's in Early Access, certain mechanics aren't integrated properly or not at all (temperature, spiritual and the heir system, in particular). Balance is all over the place, construction progression is bizarre and doesn't seem ordered properly. Most of the quests are honestly not really necessary and take away from the overall experience. I actually find it kind of predatory that it's \"1.0\" but clearly isn't complete. \n\nCustom difficulty requires more sliders and settings, such as one for Tool durability. The tool mechanic of having to constantly produce more and more tools is pretty bad tbh. It would be more respectful of player's time and more fun if you could just setup a tool repair job and as long as enough villagers are working it, tools stay in functional shape. Needs a rework for sure.\n\nsome weapon animations need to be adjusted so that they actually hit targets. The Naginata for example, the 2 opening swings hit targets like 25% of the time and clips through the ground constantly. \n\nNeeds a way to mark resource nodes on the map, or some sort of symbol system for the map. It'd also be nice to be able to zoom in a bit more than you currently can.",

            "review": "I've been playing this game nonstop for the past month but I am giving it a negative review because the optimization is too much of a problem to ignore. I'm a big fan of building games like Valheim and resource management games like Satisfactory and an even bigger fan of Japanese culture and history. Which is actually what brought my attention to this game in the first place. I recently made a Minecraft data/resource pack that reskins all of vanilla minecraft into a Japanese theme, I even called it Sengoku Jidai too. \n\nI really like the building and the resource management, it reminded me of Age of Empires except I can actually sit back and treat it like the Sims instead of devoting 100% of my attention and stress. They are a lot of QoL changes this game could use such as a better graph that tells you how many resources you are producing and consuming that is a lot more clear and cohesive than the first one. There's also a weird bug where the tool a village uses for their job will get replaced with a random item like a stick which will clog production. \n\nThe combat is serviceable and not too bad if you try not to compare it too much to Sekiro or Ghost of Tsushima. Enemy AI can be bugged sometimes and abused. \n\nAnyway, the big thing i'm talking about here is the optimization as I said before. It's a huge problem and needs to be fixed. My computer is on the higher end and can run pretty much any game, I even got perfect frames at the beginning of this game but as you progress and get more villagers you're frames will tank immensely. I'm talking 20 fps in the later game. I understand this is a building game and the more things you place the more performance-demanding it is, but I restarted the whole game and kept the assets I was placing to a bare minimum and it still reached levels of unbearable. \n\nKeep in mind I have hundreds of hours in Satisfactory; a 3D base building and automation game also coded in Unreal and I've hardly had any performance issues despite the thousands of assets I've placed down that are making multiple calculations in the background. Sengoku Dynasty is an automation game in a way but nowhere near to this complexity and yet manages to destroy my frames. Therefore I can't see this problem being something impossible for the devs to tackle and they need to patch it as soon as possible.  \n\nThe reason why I'm passionate about this problem is because I really do like this game. This game is right up my alley due to my tastes but for anyone else I wouldn't recommend it due to its sheer performance problems. If this ever gets fixed I will be more than happy to return it and give it a good review.",

I had fun, currently I would say $15 is a good cost. maybe in the future they will add more and make the game feel less like a demo. the cutscenes are nice I can see how this would be fun.

You can utilize your villagers to fetch resources for you while you're out doing other things and come back to have enough resources to add to your village.\n\nThe melee combat leaves something to be desired, but I don't find this to be as nearly big of an issue as others have made it out to seem.

I love the setting and was looking forward to playing but after an hourr I had to refund.\n\nIt becomes very quickly, very evident of how unpolished and janky the game is. \nCrafting is a huge gind: for example if you just want to build a small house, you better be ready to craft like 3 hammers and farm a ton of materials just so you can \"craft\" each wall, floor and roof separately. Its not like other games where you get the materials and place down pieces of completed walls and floors, no, you got to stand there, beating them with the hammer and each hit takes materials.\nIt is just way too micromanaged to be fun.\n\nThe combat is short of artocious. If you have more than 1 enemy going after you then melee combat just falls apart.\nThen again, most survival games have bad combat. It feels floaty, unresponsive and just overall unpolished. \n\nAs of right now I can not recommend this game, it is just way too early in early access",

            "review": "Played enough to have an opinion now. TLDR: Overall game is OK, get it on a sale, a big sale, or wait til they actually 'finish' the game. \n\nI like the community style setup, BUT Medieval Dynasty did it better. People matter in MD, they are just bodies in SD, one person is not better or worse than another, they all produce exactly the same and do not get better, MD they did and I loved that each person had their own skills. The AI in both games is meh at best but its utterly borked in SD. Enemies will run at you til they hit an invisible line and then walk backwards, or just stand there and take hits without doing anything. Your villagers will also get stuck EVERYWHERE, had 11 of them stuck in a house and had to move it to fix them, doesnt matter tho cuz they dont actually have to process the animations for work to be done. Farming by AI is instant, they plow, sow, water and fertilize as soon as you put them on the task, they can also only do 23 plots, so a 5x5 is optimal at 25 plots but 2 will be empty everytime. You cant swim, water doesnt exist you just fall to your death. The list goes on for issues, but none are overall gamebreaking, just indicative of a game thats in EA not released, for this to be 1.0 is a joke. However, I do like the combat, when it works properly, the crafting system is fine and the community building allowing you to move buildings and add to them is amazing and should be in MD too. Overall, game is decent but not finished, it feels more like a start to a game than a completed game, I know they have a roadmap for what they are adding, but what is ingame needs to be fleshed out before I will believe its 1.0.",

Alongside these issues there are an incredible amount of game ruining bugs that constantly occur, seemingly for no reason. One of the main bugs I encountered was an issue where clicking anything in my inventory that was in a stack would be split into two stacks, it made individual items unable to be dragged, it effectively made consuming food/healing items impossible, made using arrows for bows completely impossible. The combat is also incredibly flawed, 90% of the time, despite making a perfect block/parry, anyone level of enemy can just completely spam attack you to the point you can't even react. Overall this is potentially one of the poorest quality games I've ever played, I'm quite honestly impressed with how bad a game this is.",

No sense of danger, all the mobs are tied to thier camps and can be leashed without penalty (so just keep going in and out all day to whittle them down), nothing follows for too long and nothing appears to freely roam the map to catch you somewhere random.\n\nThis game could be made alot better by letting the player focus in thier chosen few progression styles and play through that way, I dont think survival type games go without having some sort of base so forgetting about the craftsman side of things progression could be developed on the other lines with different victory conditions. there feels like there are systems for that, they just need to be developed.",

While looking through the main dynasty menu (where you assign villager tasks), it refused to advance forward and then stayed on the screen. While it claimed that \"ESC\" would fix this issue, it did not. Nothing did. And you couldn't save the game, you couldn't back out, you couldn't do anything. So, I was forced to close the game losing a lot of progress. This pushed my buttons and caused a NO to recommending. Had this been a one shot time, no biggie. But this issue seems to happen often. Once this issue is addressed, however, this game would be quite entertaining. \r\n\r\nYou can build a village from nothing in your chosen area.\r\nYou have to gather EVERYTHING\r\nThere are villager quests\r\nYou must keep up with basic needs for the villagers\r\nThese are the only things I was able to do before the dreaded freeze.",

Sometimes the arrows get stuck on the invisible wall which you could pull out. If you climb over a hut or something they will just swing in the air underneath you and return back really fast to their initial position without turning in an uncanny manner. Melee is the only way to play fair for the time being.  It is quite rough around the edges and should have still been in early access imo but I like where it is going otherwise.",

            "review": "The game is very engaging! I'm excited to see the roadmap getting done for this game after ver 1. Currently in late game after starting a new game since new update. \n\nMaybe just few suggestions with wheel options for decorations, I wish the banner shows what it looks like from the wheel, I had to try every single one and forget which one I like it's just a bit annoying. For raids and heir to play after my character dies old age, oh i cannot wait til it comes! Speaking of raids, security need fix, it only show production but no reserve not like other needs like heat food, bev<- those I see what I have in storage but security got NOTHING :') I have my blacksmith making weapons too that goes to armory Idk why it's not counting my weapons in storage. \n\nFamily quest, I'd say I like medival dynasty more since the spouse gives me little things every new season, dialoge kinda change too. IN SD tho, it's always the same dialogue and can't give them gifts.\nohh and speaking of gifts, I have a tailor in the village to make better clothes and I have a ton, my villagers still wears poor quality clothes.. and they're still barefoot T_T\n\nLastly, i hope game can hold more ppl in village without the lag when i run around. I think it'll level up more my time in my villages and actually wanna stay and chill with the villagers",

            "review": "The game takes place in the Sengoku era of Japan, where your goal is to rebuild a dynasty from the ground up and liberate the areas around you. This game is brimming with potential, and the developers frequently release updates, which makes me excited to see how it will continue to grow in both gameplay and lore.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of the game is the NPCs. I’ve grown very attached to some of them and love creating a comfortable life for my favorite villagers. The game gives you complete control over your people and village management, down to the smallest details. Whether it’s assigning tasks or managing resources, it feels deeply satisfying to see your community thrive.\r\n\r\nAnother great feature is the ability to customize the gameplay experience. For example, I’m not a fan of combat, but the game allows me to turn fighting off in the settings. This flexibility makes it accessible for different playstyles.\r\n\r\nThe world itself is stunning, with breathtaking landscapes that immerse you in the beauty of feudal Japan. However, I have one critique: the character creation options are quite limited, which feels a bit restrictive. Hopefully, they expand on this in future updates!\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy open-world games with building, production, and management elements, Sengoku Dynasty is definitely worth trying. Plus, you can customize the world to your liking and even share the experience with up to three friends in multiplayer mode. Whether you play solo or co-op, this game is an engaging journey.",

The biggest thing I wish for in this game is changes to the in-game map. It would be amazing if the map auto-generated every time you start a new save, or if the villages and bandit camps had random spawn points. I know it sounds like a tall order, but it would seriously boost the game's replayability.",

I was excited when the game was finally released, but it is now ruined by the absolute awful enemy AI. Enemies often stop mid chase and seem to be absolutely clueless, then turn around and go about their day, until you return and they start the chase again.\r\n\r\n When firing arrows directly at the enemy, sometimes the arrows hit a invisible wall between yourself and the enemy, and just float until you pick them up. No damage to the enemy at all. And when an enemy strikes you, you get stuck in a constant loop of the enemy performing ridiculous flips, while not being able to dodge or parry the attack in any way.\r\n\r\nI'll give this game another chance when the AI is (hopefully) patched",

I hope they introduce some mechanics for connecting the buildings together in a more coherent manner because as of now with only roadworks as a way to pave or alter the ground in any way and with all the buildings being on stills, it feels like you're building some jungle or swamp hamlet of rickety shacks more than the medieval Japanese village its meant to be.\n\nDevs, please add more steps options than those hideous bamboo stairs if you're not gonna have a better way of building on the ground. Every single building having those visible wood supports instead of a stone foundation feels very jarring. I understand its an easy way of circumventing terrain issues, but it looks terrible. \n\nVillager interactions are pretty meaningless and underwhelming. It never feels like they actually live in their houses or own anything. I hope the devs can make it more obvious that a certain house belongs to a certain NPC/s and enable some kind of personal touch in terms of more decorations and furniture options. \n\nI love this game and I can see great potential in it. I hope development doesnt end with what feels like a premature 1.0 release.",

The game is sometimes rough, the combat is clunky and the IA so easily cheesable you need to go out of your way to not abuse it. When it works, it's satisfying though ! It would hugely benefit from some QoL updates that are really lacking in my opinion, like the ability to sort and categorize the job tab, which is a bit of a nuisance when you get over the 20-30 population mark and, I imagine, is really frustrating when you max out population.\n\nAlso the ability to make indoor walls for the houses, having a \"luxury\" wall skin available for non-manor houses, and maybe a couple more larger indoor decoration items would make building villages even more satisfying in my opinion.\n\nTo summarize, buy the game if you like the idea of a chill and pretty game set in an interesting historical setting, that is mostly base building and resource managing, a good bit of exploring and grinding resources, a decent but discreet rpg element. But be aware that you'll keep seeing little clunky bits here and there. Personally I don't regret it. I do hope the game keeps being updated as I really want to see its full potential but even as is, it's good.",

My only real issue is honestly the rendering, as i feel it could be better optimised to reduce the amount of stuttering (Most notably during combat) Though, I have also taken into account my potato PC (In todays standards anyways... 4 years ago this thing rocked) which is most definitely a part of my stutter/lag issue.\r\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, I dont have much to complain at all, but rather some ideas that I believe could enhance the game greatly, such as; \r\nAdding a Barracks where players can recruit and build a type of military force to help in the civil unrest, protect the villages, as well as help seek out refugees.\r\nAdding an alliance system between the various villages and factions\r\nBeing able to negotiate terms with the local Bandit Leaders.\r\nA companion system to perhaps hire, bring the players child, or enlist some troops to accompany the player on their travels.\r\nA pet system would be adorable and fantastic in my honest opinon.\r\nLivestock... We needs the livestock!!!!!! :p\r\nHorses, and perhaps working carts?\r\n(These ideas would also be amazing to see in Medieval Dynasty :D)",

I have reached out to the developers for help only to be told it has to be something with my internet and not the game or if it is the game it is something in the netcode that is the problem and they will \"try to find the problem\". Keep in mind that I am not the only person who has this issue. Other players do as well you can check their discord in the bug section. I can play any other game ever created on my internet with no problem but apparently my internet is the issue and the reason this game doesn't work according to the devs. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, checked my firewall, turned off VPN, turned on beta mode that was suggested and literally nothing worked. I was told the update that came out on Monday would fix co-op but it didn't then I was told the update that just came out 2 days ago fixed it and it still doesn't work. Why offer co-op if half your player base can't get in to their friends game or it bugs out during co-op like I have seen other people in discord post about. Save your money if you were hoping to play with friends because it doesn't work. They also told my friend it was fixed on his review and we can both confirmed it in fact has not been fixed. We tried 30 seconds ago with no progress. New game, old save doesn't matter.",

Since you are giving me controller options here, like RB, I would expect to use a controller and hit RB to do something.\n\nAnnoying pop screen message that fills most of the screen about different classes, stats, legendary perks that will not close no matter how many times you hit the damn ESC button. Since the message is overlaid and acts independently on the, ongoing screen behind it, even if you do get your mouse over the message it still won't close!\n\nRepawning to get out of annoying said message and then finding your character hardlocked in place with no ability to move no matter if you're using the mouse / controller etc. \n\nRunning around a completely barren and pretty clear-cut tiny map once you leave the starting area and while wondering who really needs a swimming animation when you can just run across the bottom of the water and not even lose life for it.\n\nIf it's this screwed up in the first hour of playing, I would only assume it gets worse once I really started. \n\nFor 30 bucks they should have cooked it longer before serving.",

Better build 3 or 4 hammers because those will keep breaking as you go. Need more logs to build those hammers (and also the house)? Better build 3 or 4 axes for that. \n\nThis coupled with an annoying progression system that is locked based on what regions you have yet to take over means that upgrading is slow, requires a lot of resources that are tedious to gather, and the rate at which you villagers do it is not enough to offset this. \n\nAdded to the grind is a clunky combat system. This game should have stayed in Early Access a while longer so it may be a good game to waste a few hours in if you can get it at a decent discount.",

Sort of like a boring, less rewarding and takes longer to see a finished product than bonsai.\n\nIt falls very very short. Devs promising the world and writing lots about updates but taking years to implement them seems par for the course. Its certainly the case in this game. \n\nits ok in everything it sets out to do for say a 20 quid game, but it doesnt really cut it with games like Icarus updating weekly. Medieval Dynasty wipes the floor with it and its beaten hands down by Bellwright. Which i have to mention, Ive not played the autumn Medieval Dynasty update at this point because Bellwright has it all and in more depth. Its still really janky but at least you can envision it constantly improving from a solid title. Which it already is.\n\nSorry Devs claiming this has a Daimyo system is like actually really insulting to gamers intelligence and probably ancient japan too. Your Ikigai seems to be not in developing a finished title. Feel free to keep patronising gamers by mansplaining Japan badly and drip feeding new character face updates every six months.\n\nRemember when games were sold as finished products anyone? 5 outta 10 from my ass.\n",

Made steel tier items. All that good stuff. The game has a lot of charm, But also leaves a lot to be desired. Calling this the 1.0 version was already quite overconfident. Now you guys are asking to be nominated for a steam award?? It's a decent game, don't get me wrong, but cozy/relaxing game of the year? Nah bro. This game worked fine 2 weeks ago as I had been playing with my bud for like 2 to 3 weeks straight. Now I'm getting unreal engine crashes when playing alone and when hosting co-op, my friend can't even join. He gets a black screen in which he hears my character chopping wood and switching items while he logged out and should log back in halfway across the map from where I am?? Such a damn shame man. This game has so much potential but for some reason the development is evolving... BACKWARDS!!!",

I like what it tries to do, but lacks many quality of life standards which should come by default these days. Gamepad controls are flimsy and you can't change it. Customisation is also greatly lacking and optimisation needs some work, stuttering is common.\n\nIt has great potential, and it's a good example that you don't need ambition to make a decent game. I just wish it had a bit more polish, its current state feels like it was released prematurely.\n\nI don't want to give it a negative review, because I genuinely love the concept. But until there's been some substantial patches, I can't recommend it either. I'll change my review to positive in the future, when--and if--the game approaches the more release-ready state it should have been in.",

So we waited patiently in excitement for Sengoku to release as 1.0.\nBoy oh boy, was it a surprise jumping into it.\n\nThe game feels like playing alpha build straight in the engine, everything is clipping, popping, disappearing, flashing. We have different information on resources needed when playing coop, unexplained errors when building, literally so many issues and bugs thats its actually impressive there could be SO MANY DIFFERENT ONES.\nGame performance is insanely bad, game is jumping between 20 to 80 fps every couple seconds, loading textures ALL the time. Another player teleporting is freezing both game instances, ridiculous and borderline playable. Setting everything to Low does 0-5% fps gain from Epic.\n\nThe good:\n- Visually building your village - THE ONLY good part of this game\n\nThe bad:\n- Balance and challenge - sucks, teleporting is basically free, no tax, lack of purpose, no child/dynasty system\n- Combat - its boring, basic, unexplained, stuttering unfair, clunky af\n- Locations and POI - expanses of nothing, sparse animals, caves are so empty its like 1995\n- Audio and Music - bare minimum, 0 satisfaction, some sounds out of place\n- UI design - its so bad, 0 filters, 0 customization, absolutele nightmare to manage any village above 20 ppl\n- Story and NPC - I see the intention but it feels like the budget for it was cut right away, slapped some cutscenes that feel too long and relevant to the gameplay struggles\n- Probably more but lets just stop\n\n\nAs a fellow game dev I can probably guess that the team was heavily underfunded and was cutting corners/features like crazy in spite of highly ambitious initial plans but its so sad the game HAS to be released when clearly no sane person on the team would call it ready to leave early access.\n\nIt feels like alpha v0.6 - it has a great premise and so much potential but its failing at EVERY fundamental aspect.\nPlease at least fix this insanely bad performance so we can finish our village asap without going mental from watching single digit fps drops every couple seconds. I would love to revisit this game someday, enjoy it as much as Medieval Dynasty and change my review to Positive, wishing best to the devs.",

I dangle this carrot and you can get this/these recipes unlocked.  Some you can unlock for cash but to be honest their pre-requisites are most likely plot or achievement locked so cash really only matters mid to late game in picking up the \"that'd be nice I guess\" recipes.\r\n\r\nWhat the global achievements tell me is that if this is a game type that you are familiar with, most likely from playing the medieval version, then pick it up.\r\n\r\nIf you are dipping your toe in the genre dip elsewhere.  There's too much in game decoding and intuition required to play to any enjoyable means.\r\n\r\n85% of players/owners/licensees haven't mastered building a stone axe and cutting down a full sized tree.\r\n\r\nThat is not my opinion.

            "review": "The building selection UI is horrible and still black&white while the rest of the game looks great. There were a lot of times I was really confused in which section what building or whatever structure is. It needs a rework into something either standard or more intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe game does not provide guidance on progression. It is true that the game is survival type, yet survival is the easiest thing to do - in fact, after 1h of gameplay you will forget this fact. The game is all about unlocking building and items, then managing your villages and population. So I thought, why not just kick everyone out and just keep building stuff to upgrade myself and just razing the map. Well on normal and  difficulty(probably also higher) you also have to build special project that require villagers which tend to leave you if they are not happy. Bummer. The big problem is that in order to balance something you will be recruiting people and assign them jobs, but the more you recruit the more stuff you unlock and with that more problems/villager needs. It was really hard to make every box green. In fact I only managed to do it while on 50 population and still the spiritual/luxury needs were in red(last unlockable needs) - never really enjoyed the gameplay because of it. It was a constant struggle to figure out what to do with the village.\r\n\r\nYou can build only 4 villages(and probably 100 villagers) in total but you can not demolish the previous. The map has regions and regions have resources, your villagers can harvest. The problem is that once you unlock iron, you won't need bronze, so if i made a mistake by settling in starter area like everyone else who did not read forums/wiki, then you are f-ed because you will need such things like ice and later more resources. This shows that you will not be able to automate everything by using villagers. So why struggle with base management to begin with?\r\n\r\nThe resource management UI is also bad. It does not allow to pick the amount i would like to store for Winter or, as another example, \"get and keep 20 bronze in storage, after that amount continue on consuming it on whatever\".\r\n\r\nWhy can't I assign the same person to work on different things during different season without manual intervention?(or to do the same with building resources) This made every production like even more annoying to manage. For example, during winter almost nothing grows, so you either stock up(which you should) or choose different things to grow like wasabi or enoki mushrooms or hunt for meat, get more fish.\r\n\r\nThe game does not guide you towards the usefulness of the items much. This is either because of the UI or lack of guidance. Want better heat? Get charcoal kiln. How? F you. Want to know which food gives you more village needs right from the menu? Lol, go to the traders and look for that food. I would really appreciate an in game \"help\" section where i can look for every recipe or mechanic instead of checking said wiki and forums.\r\n\r\nThe whole game is pretty much like this. Go build special projects and kill boss in the region if it has one. There is really nothing else to do. There are quests, but those are really silly and irrelevant except the one that gives you the bell to establish another village.\r\n\r\nThe combat approach is weird but it works. Essentially you are a 1 man army against the map. Can't use villagers for anything related to combat.\r\n\r\nProbably the biggest goal of the game is to get as rich as possible and as fast as possible. Without money you can't unlock anything and have only other choice of scavenging - not for the game progression, but for base management - it doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe this game is made to play on the creative mode an not on any other difficulty otherwise it's just not worth the time. It has good graphics, theme, music but most mechanics are simply bad and not enjoyable by the balancing the game gives you. I do understand that it could be more efficient to play as 4 people multiplayer, but at that point, the game is not worth its price. I'd recommend just skipping this game as it does not deliver equal or more worth than something standard like DayZ or Subnautica.",

It also doesn't feel feature complete and suffers from graphical stuttering from time to time.  I also wish the graphics were a little bit better when it comes to your character.\r\n\r\nWith that being said the music and game play were very fun for me. I was able to get lost in a little world for a few hours. I can't wait to see how the game gets flushed out in the next few months / years.",

They have show they care about the project which I can't say many companies do with their games anymore! I would happily give the game the full price over and over!

            "review": "Sengoku Dynasty turned out to be a very enjoyable experience for me. First and foremost, I was impressed by the beautifully designed world – the graphics are truly pleasing to the eye, and the environment invites you to explore and discover its secrets. The building system is one of the best I’ve ever seen. It’s intuitive, satisfying, and offers a lot of creative freedom, making it a real joy to develop my settlement.\n\nI also loved how versatile the game is – from resource management to village development, there’s so much to do. The mechanics are engaging, although not all of them feel fully polished. Some of them gave me the impression they were originally intended for something else, which affects their overall cohesion a bit.\n\nThe story is simple, but that works in its favor – it doesn’t overwhelm you and lets you focus on enjoying the gameplay itself. The resource management system works well enough, although I think it could be a little more intuitive.\n\nOn the downside, there are a few things that bothered me. For instance, the lack of livestock is understandable from a historical perspective, but the absence of horses and the ability to ride them was quite disappointing. The world sometimes feels a bit empty – there are no NPCs walking along the paths, and random events involving characters could have added more life to the experience. The enemy AI also falls short of expectations.\n\nDespite these flaws, Sengoku Dynasty offers plenty of satisfaction and enjoyment. I’ve spent many delightful hours with this game, and I can genuinely recommend it, even though it’s not perfect.",

            "review": "I am writing the negative review for this game with a heavy heart, because I absolutely loved playing the early access version. The village building is fun, managing your villages's needs can be difficult but generally manageable, and the visuals and sound are beautiful and immersive. The basic gameplay loop feels pretty good and seeing your village grow from nothing to a bustling town is satisfying.\nThat being said, this game should not be released yet. It was fantastic for an early access game. There were many issues, but I though to myself, these will surely be fixed with the full release. \nI was wrong.\nThe game as it is now simply feels unfinished. I have to wonder if the developers even bothered to have dedicated playtests done. The issues I'm seeing here aren't even major things, since the essential gameplay works, but small quality of life issues that cause the game to die of a thousand paper cuts. For example, your hunger bar is in the bottom left corner, where you rarely look if you are just building your town, but there is no audio queue to tell you that you are hungry, so I have starved to half my health before even realizing that I need to eat. You can set the exact amount of an item your villagers should craft or gather, in some cases on a range of 1-250, but you have to do it via clicking on the increase/decrease arrow repeatedly. You can upgrade previously built beds, but that registers them as new bed and the previous bed as destroyed, so your assigned villager not only loses their home, but their job, and you have to reassign everything for them again (and click on decrease 100 times again). There is no way to filter the UI for a certain job, so if you want to know how many villagers are gathering wood for example, you have to scroll and look and hope that you aren't missing any woodworkers you have assigned.\nI am honestly severely disappointed. This game is feature complete, but feels like not a second was spent on making sure that the existing features don't just work, but work well. I can only hope that these issues are solved in future updates, but until then, i cannot in good faith recommend such a rushed release.",

I'm happy to say that's not the case, and they've added some solid innovation to the \"Dynasty\" formula.\n\nA couple of highlights for players who are familiar with Medieval Dynasty:\n[list][*] No weight!  Instead you have limited inventory slots as the limiting factor, but no more struggling to move because you picked up too many logs.\n[*] The \"conquest\" of regions unlocks new resources and technologies.  And \"conquest\" doesn't necessarily mean fighting the bandits; it can be as simple as constructing a watchtower in a region or rebuilding a bridge along a border.\n[*] There are several \"project\" sites, which require a number of resources to be delivered and workers assigned.  However, once complete these add unique structures to the world (and usually give you a bonus).\n[*] Skills unlock much more quickly, which leads to a steady feeling of progress.  I'm not 100% sure on this, but there doesn't seem to be a level/skill cap for each of the paths - so given enough time, you may be able to unlock all the skills.\n\nIf you enjoy Medieval Dynasty and want to try something similar (but still unique), or if you're just interested in a \"peasant-focused\" resource management and city-builder game, I highly recommend giving Sengoku Dynasty a try.",

It will be ok for a early access game but this is not ready for the 1.0 version. I wait for it and now it doesn't have the expected quality.\n\nBugs like:\n\n- When you save/load the game, some structures lose the reference for the tools that you use and suddenly they are using \"herb\" as a tool instead of a \"hammer\", so if you don't check all of them when you load, you will lose some production\n\n-  When you save/load the game, you lose all of the priorities that you has assigned to the village\n\n- The tool maker is not working at all, and you cannot automate the tool creation\n\n- Some products are not made like for example wood. It works well if you use it but they don't gerenate it sometime \n\n\nAnd some more like this",

Des rolls back, de l'incapacité à choisir un outil, ou même, de pouvoir choisir un outil sans l'utiliser. C'est assez relou, et ça nécessite pas mal de déco reco, et c'est assez barbant. J'espère  que ça sera assez vite patch, tout comme certaines textures au travers desquelles on se bloque sans raison, ou bien du fait qu'on saute de 2 mètres de haut et qu'on perde de la vie. Enfin bref, à part ça, cela reste un très bon jeu !",

Combat is fun and challenging, and the variety of weapons makes it interesting.\n\nI can praise many things the dev team did in-game. But I think nothing I say will stand out and highlight dev's passion for this project than pointing out the game was in Early Access no longer than it was estimated (or maybe a little bit, but nothing major,) their road map was informative and they kept adding and improving.\nUnlike many other Early Access games where dev sometimes tends to disappear halfway through, Sengoku Dynasty not only finished everything planned, but also kept the community informed.",

The game is big and tries yet fails to create a smooth running experience when traversing the game.  Jerky motions of the camera as it tries to generate the area is very normal.\n\nThe combat needs tweaks because some of my late game battles went like this \"enemy power attacks, I dodge and counter, enemy blocks my counter and counters hitting me several times before I can try anything else\".  Only the tanto knife felt like the safest way to fight as area leaders are highly prone to doing what i mentioned above over and over again.  The knife being the fastest to use helps you make up for their quick block counters but still is tiresome due to enemies having unlimited stamina to attack you with.\n\nDespite this game not being complete it is enjoyable to build Japanese style settlements that aren't inspired by anime.  The special projects were nice but if you could create your own special projects that gave you some kind of benefit that would be awesome.  Also, perk systems are great, but in order to get all the perks in this game it would take you months of grinding to do that, and as of now, ain't nobody got time fo dat.",

You can even start the game with custom rules where you don't even have to fight at all.\r\n\r\nI was initially put off by how precise you have to be to pick stuff up from the ground, and how sometimes you have to point your camera slightly to the side of your objective to harvest/chop/pick.  But once you get past those qwirks, it's quite an enjoyable game.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised less than 10% of players even setup a village.",

With different teams assigned to different games, they all feel distinctly different despite essentially being the same game model (if you like Sengoku, you'll probably like Medieval Dynasty at the very least). But it is these small differences that keeps them fresh, and makes each its own distinct product. Every time more content is added, I see something I was hoping for, and I hope they continue this for years to come to build one of the best possible games in the genre.",

There's lots of reasons to explore (finding shrines, foraging, etc), the project and liberation systems are satisfying, it's visually great and the combat is pretty solid. The entire system of recruitment & housing & expansion & villager needs is pretty transparent and engaging, and the way advancement is tied to the metaplot is pretty neat.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, it expects you to explore and experiment. For example, straw. You'll need a lot of straw over time. It's made from grass, and you can hand-craft it at a 2:1 ratio. However, if you look around in the construction interface (i.e. hold a hammer, right click and explore the radial menu), you can find a Drying Rack. Not only does it fully automate the crafting (grass converts to straw over time, place grass and collect straw later), it produces it at a 1:1 ratio. [i]Absolutely nothing even hinted this existed.[/i]\r\n\r\nIt badly needs an internal wiki or reference, where you can look items up, see what they do and how/where they're produced. Right now there's a pile of things you can unlock with (non-microtransaction) currency, but it's hard to tell what's useful from that interface.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, a rough gem is still a gem. It really wants for some QoL, but what exists today is a solid experience.",

I love the music, I love the vibe, I love how it rains, and it just feels fun to play, however, i do have more cons than pros..\n\nWe don't have a toggle to sprint at all so you are constantly having to hold shift in order to run (which is weird because my sister can press shift once and it automatically lets her run whereas with me, i have to hold it down but whatever). I should be able to switch between quick-slot items by simply using my scroll wheel rather than having to use numbers as its a lot easier. The rubber banding is a big problem in this game, I rubber band probably every 5 minutes and its absolutely terrible. Quick maps should be implemented in the game for those who don't want to use the compass, so we should be able to have the option to use either or. The stamina rate is terrible even if you use your perks to unlock a faster stamina rate. \nNow let's get to the main topic at hand which is the men. Why are the men's hairline receding? I don't understand. Each and every single one of the refugee's hairlines are receding, what makes you think I want to have a child with a man whose hairline is receding? I don't. The men that we have to procreate with are all ugly, the customization is extremely limited, other than all of this I do like the game but again, I'm playing multiplayer w/my sister, if I was playing this solo I would've most likely refunded the game. :)",

I hope im able to get a refund, im furious and insanely disappointed, i hope this company includes the specifics of what they need or make it so the error work arounds actually work that -dx12 and -d3d12 is useless.

            "review": "Noticed that this wasn't on early access anymore, so I got it. What did I get? - A jank game with a jank village management system and an empty world. The open world bit just feels empty, there wasn't much left to do after you went out and discovered the few other villages that were there and cleared out some bandit camps or roamed around to acquire the few resources I required. The bandit camps do not seem to respawn, so those are only a one time thing. I didn't read any guides when I started out, reading guides usually ruins the game for me, I like to figure things out on my own. So, managing the village upkeep doesn't leave you much room to screw up and it's never really fully automated, you always need to craft or gather something. You'll be pulling your hair out trying to manage the village with its awful lists and misinformed abstract production numbers and no way to easily calculate the total expenditure of your resources. First of all, every building needs to be linked up to the correct storage facilities. At first, the general storage will do, but eventually you need to build several other types of storage buildings, each requiring a building of their own and you need to make sure that each production building is properly set up. I had a ton of trouble managing the village maintenance, because four carpenters in a village of less than thirty people were barely able to keep up with the maintenance quota, my rickety shacks were suddenly falling apart left and right, the only way I managed produce any lumber again was to get a large stockpile of clay, mine it manually and then burn through it in hopes of getting more villagers. But if you think that getting more villagers might help - you're dead wrong! The more people your \"dynasty\" has, the more stuff they need. Pass a certain threshold and suddenly everyone needs a ton of cough medicine, which means reworking your entire production chain all over again. Why do I need to manually change each forager individually to pick different a different type of mushroom during the summer and winter? - Why can't you just tell them to go pick up any edible mushroom they come across that happens to be available in each season - there are many such similar annoying cases of micromanagement with this game. You cannot set up a proper production of items separately for each season, you need to always fiddle and tinker around with the people's workplace or micromanage the menus and it gets really bothersome to do with the janky lists and the scarce amount of information. So, after cough medicine, comes security, which means more work for the blacksmith to craft weapons, in addition to the hammers, axes, adzes, knives, bells and whistles that they're already crafting! That also means you need to designate some of your villagers as 'warriors' at guard towers to guard them from enemies that never seem to invade your village. After that, your villagers start requiring spiritual items, so you need to start crafting straw hats, God forbid you craft any other spiritual item than straw hats because you cannot keep up with the demand. Let's say that you'll try to satisfy your villager's needs for spiritual items with expensive and hard to produce deity stones, used for building shrines - That's a big no, because your villagers smoke large deity stones like crack. After spiritual items, it's time for luxury items and that means, you guessed it, more different type of straw hats! Ok, that's no big deal, those are made of straw but make sure not to run out of straw or your entire straw production halts - you always need to have items needed for production and upkeep stockpiled if you wish for the villagers to produce. At some point, you might reach a point where everything balances correctly and you can finally stop worrying about the village's numbers staying green and only need to craft seed bags or some other item only once every few seasons. Then you finally go out to the empty world and get mauled by a bear and pick up from a save and you realize that the game's been saving every five minutes through the entire time that you've played it and each save file is sized at around 14~mb, WHY? Thanks for hogging up the space on my SSD! Why is there no limit on how many autosaves the game creates, do you really need tens... hundreds of autosaves? \nThe final straw was the God-forsaken Ore Processing Plant, I built it, made a town, eventually set a worker there to mine iron ore, using a steel pickaxe. The worker's production tab tells me that the building is producing a good amount of iron ore, ok. I go to bed, do a time skip, and the plant does not produce a single nugget. Why does the game have to flat out lie about it? Then I realized - it's a special jank building that you cannot add items inside of it, so you probably cannot link it to a storage building at all, but the game just decides to flat out lie about the amount of iron it produces. Then, finally, I try to look up information on the ore plant and there is none, besides a few random discussions - there are no guides, no tips, no hints and no tricks on how to work it. Probably because there have ever only been a handful of individuals who've persisted as far as to have first, building the thing, and then tried connecting it to a town and then use it - Only found a few discussions from 2023 saying that it's bugged and doesn't work. And now, here I am, writing an over 5,000 letter rant. Do not buy - it's still early access carp, it's nowhere near complete. Save yourself from frustration that is... Sengoku Dynasty.",

            "review": "1.0 has been pretty underwhelming.    I really loved the EA and was very much excited for this game, but the latest release feels very rushed, and that's disappoint because it's ALMOST a really great game.  However, the new update does NOT mesh with previous updates and they really need to take it back to development to fix it up.\n\nI'll caveat I've gotten three villages and \"control\" most of the map, so I'm not sure but consider myself approaching end-game (e.g. about to unlock the last set of buildings).\n\nFor details: I'll compare it to Medieval Dynasty, as it's in the same genre.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Some improvements over Village Management in Medival Dynasty.\n  - Luxury, Spiritual and Safety needs are interesting\n  - Filling needs with *jobs* and services, vs. items is good addition\n- Interesting combat system.\n  - Very different animations across weapons\n  - Enemy camp \"dungeons\" with bosses to take down\n- Region Control mechanic.  Requires \"building\" key control points to gain access to advanced resources.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Pacing. They added quests in EA and for this release they just changed them all with Region Control so that the quest and story just doesn't make sense anymore.  E.g. there's a quest to learn ironworking that requires you to advance much past where the quest is to acheive the quest.  Additionally the quest is still worded as if it unlocked ironworking (like in EA), when in fact it does nothing of the sort.  Lots of instances where mid-game \"better recipes\" is locked behind quests, but you can rush towards later game recipes instead with better outcomes.\n- Clunky. There's a LOT of missing quality of life features.  E.g. a notice that workers are doing something not valid in the current season, a notice that workers don't have enough source material for the % you have them allocated to a task.  Or even just the ability to *sort* in any menu, ever.\n- Economy. The one BIG missing feature from Medieval Dynasty is having sales people sell your stuff.  I usually have my villagers make massive amounts of one item and I craft/derive the needs from there.  However, at some point I wound up with a ridiculous number of logs and it was VERY hard to craft all of them or even sell them, due to how the interfaces work.  This is after I had moved to oil for heat, but had forgotten to tone down the deforestation.\n\n\nThe Ugly\n\n- Base/Town Building.  They have TONS of great decoration, but simple things like getting walls to line up or controlling the roof-style of *some* buildings is buggy or not working.  There's no great way to control the terrain around your base, and some buildings you expect to line up (like mansions/monastery) just may never line up if you didn't pick flat enough ground.\n- Depth. Crafting is fun. Combat is fun. Managing the Village is fun.  But you can easily get to a point where you're either doing something you've already done a thousand times.  Additionally, leveling \"monk\"/\"spiritual\" just never made sense to me and I could barely get anything out of it.  I wish there was more quests or content around this aspect of the game.  Or that having a family actually DID something, not just \"hey great, we sent your kid somewhere else to live\".\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do like the game, I just think once you get past the early game it just leaves you hanging with what looks like deep, rich content, but isn't.\n",

As a huge fan of Japanese culture and the Sengoku period, the atmosphere and historical elements truly resonate with me.\n\nThat said, the game's biggest issue is its performance, which is severely lacking in optimization.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCase: Fractal Design Torrent Black Solid\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D\nCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15 chromax.black\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Aorus X670E Master\nMemory: 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) - 6000 MHz (G.Skill Z5 Neo C30)\nGraphics Card: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 (Asus Strix)\nPrimary Storage: Samsung 990 Pro 2TB\nSecondary Storage: None\nPower Supply: Corsair HX1000i\nDespite having such high-end hardware, the game suffers from significant FPS fluctuations, dropping from 140 FPS down to as low as 30 FPS at times. This inconsistency makes for a frustrating experience. It's no surprise that many players report crashes and performance issues.\n\nA patch was released on November 15th, but it’s unclear what it addressed since the optimization issues remain largely unresolved. While I appreciate the effort, the game still struggles to perform even on a system like mine.\n\nI want to leave a positive review because I genuinely like the game. However, I caution others not to be misled by the recommended specs—the game does not run well, even on top-tier hardware.\n\nMaybe it runs smoothly in the main menu?",

I have also only played singleplayer.  \n\n[b]However, the things it does well, it does really well:[/b]  \n\n- The atmosphere, music and environments are fantastic.  \n- Combat is great, there are plenty of weapons and the combat style, a mix of Dark Souls/Valheim/Ghost of Tsushima, is very enjoyable. \n- The gaming and the progression loop, which to me feels like a mix of Valheim (exploration and progression) and Manor Lords (building and production system), is very enjoyable and satisfying and is probably one of the strongest aspects of this game.  \n- The building system took some time to get used to, especially coming from Valheim, but now I truly enjoy it.  \n- A surprising number of game mechanics, from building and production to combat difficulty, can be adjusted to suit your style and I would recommend using this for a first playthrough. This game can be a very relaxing and atmospheric building/production management game but can also be tuned into a fairly hardcore survival experience.  \n- I love the way you can decorate your village in this game, more lamps for the people. \n\n[b]Some of the bugs and issues that needs to be mentioned:[/b] \n\n- Game performance is at times problematic even with a newer PC. The issue I have encountered is severe FPS drop when fighting the bigger camps and sometimes (rarely) when fighting small camps. \n- The weird way your character and NPCs get stuck on things like trees and rocks can be very annoying.  \n\n[b]Personal opinions:[/b] \n\n- The way your villager needs scale feels unbalanced at points unless adjusted. But this could be a skill issue.  \n- Even when played with controller, the combat feels a little imprecise, though this could also be a skill issue. Hit boxes are a little strange.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game, and I do believe the game is well worth the current price, but there is a lot of potential still left here.

It's got a bit of everything. It has a decent amount of content, and I think you definitely get your money's worth.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, my god is it buggy and unpolished. This feels like a very early access game in terms of polish. It shouldn't be 1.0. I've been playing it in co-op and issues are common. Sometimes they're bad enough to force me to quit the game and restart it.\r\n\r\nIt needs serious work and polish. If that happens, this game would be absolutely awesome imho. Right now it's fun, but the bugginess is really holding it back.",

Rather than building a single village you're now building several, and of course a different back story in a different country and culture.\n\nUnfortunately some of the mechanics that worked in Medieval got nerfed in Sengoku.  Farming is far less effeciently managed.  Citizens lose their assigned homes/tasks whenever any kind of edits are made to their residence or work places.  Combat is you vs the entire map and is quite janky.  Hitting targets at range only works while they are stationary and mouse movement is extremely twitchy, I truly come to hate the combat mechanics.  Best success comes from save scumming.\n\nThe tech unlock system requires a lot of detailed reading, if you don't like reading then you will struggle to advance in this game.\n\nDespite some very stunning graphics, I found the combat system just too non-friendly and ruined the game for me.  I'm going to find something else to play.",

Overall its a pretty fun game for a in person colony game but feels like it could have been much better. \r\n\r\nThe big difference I found between this game and Medieval Dynasty is this has more focus on combat and less on production.  The battle system is very basic and if you get enough healing potions you can win in any fight.\r\n\r\nEven with all the negative I have listed I still enjoyed playing the game but after 50 hours I think i got my moneys worth.

The field could disappear from the place where it was located. Upgrading a bed would evict a villager from his house, fire him from his job, and irreversibly reset his workflow. When using the field management menu, there was a bug where it was impossible to close the menu. \r\nAlso, I was really hopeful for the Ukrainian localization in this game. In the Ukrainian localization, there are whole sentences in Russian. The localization itself has many errors. The meaning of the sentences is lost. It looks as if the russian text was entered into Google Translate and passed off as the Ukrainian localization. Now I can't play online with my friends because other players get a black screen when they connect to the server. \r\nI dream of going back in time and not buying this product.",

I had this game on my eyes long ago but saw lots of bad reviews about optimisation and its true even after release. \nMaybe dev need to change recommended PC requirements because I am using better than that yet will crash, shutter, lag etc etc. \nThere is even 'placeholder' items in the game AFTER the release which is strange. \nIssues with the terrains is such a headache, you can slip and slide of something and fall to take dmg or die outright. Combat is terrible because soft-locking of targets is shit when fighting multiple enemies, and when doing heavy attacks with two handed weapons the enemies will have infinite poise to tank it and attack but they will get stunned WHEN they are not attacking and just standing around. \nThere is many many smaller problems and nuances but I won't cover them here.\nIf I get paid playing this I will come back, I wish I could refund it after the 1.0.0.10 update everything became worst. \n\nTLDR: Play only if free, Don't get baited by release.

            "review": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nSengoku Dynasty is a beautiful blend of strategy, village building, and RPG gameplay, set in the breathtaking landscapes of feudal Japan. It’s a game that pulls you in with its deep mechanics and keeps you engaged with its endless possibilities.\n\nWhy It’s a Must-Play\nThe game excels in creating a vibrant, immersive world where every decision matters. You can build your dynasty from the ground up—managing resources, expanding your village, and forging alliances to shape your legacy. The visuals and sound design are stunning, and the dynamic weather adds a layer of realism that’s hard to beat.\n\nPerfect for Streaming\nFor streamers, this game shines! While you can’t rename villagers (yet), the ability to design and grow a village based on chat suggestions creates a unique interactive experience. My viewers love helping decide where to build, what to trade, and how to approach challenges.\nCheck out my live streams of Sengoku Dynasty here:\n\n🎮 Twitch: twitch.tv/TATTDADDYGRIM\n📹 TikTok: tiktok.com/@TATTDADDYGRIM\n\nJoin the journey and watch the dynasty grow!",

            "review": "I can see the vision, but this game needs A LOT of work. The concept of building a bustling town by hand is very appealing, but this game just feels dead. None of the NPCs really matter. All your villagers just exist to produce and consume resources. They do not feel like your faithful townspeople, they are robots. There is no one to latch onto. They say nothing of substance. Not to mention that they are butt ugly and visually identical to each other. In playing from the actual perspective of the town's leader, I would imagine there's at least a surface-level connection to my people, but I feel nothing for them. They barely even benefit me. Everything they do is in service of meeting the consumption/production quota. Why wouldn't I just play a traditional city builder? What's the point of me having boots on the ground?\n\nThat's my main criticism, but there are other things that irk me, too. \n\nThere's little point in having a season system. All the food sources you're likely using still function year round. There's no temperature system or anything so winter is just a visual change. You don't need to wear warm clothes, nor do your townspeople. Same idea with summer.\n\nThere's a clothing slot for gloves but in 14 hours I have seen no glove items. They might not exist. I've read that the slot is a holdover from early access that wasn't removed in 1.0 [EDIT: this has apparently been fixed in a post 1.0 update]. That's already pretty annoying to me, but wait until you hear about the \"Dynasty\" part of \"Sengoku Dynasty\".\n\nHere is a quote from the store page:\n\"DYNASTY MANAGEMENT: Create a prosperous dynasty for generations to come. Oversee the growth and development of your villages. Get married and ensure your legacy continues through your successor.\"\n\nAs you can see, one of the main selling points of this game is starting a family of your own, thereby \"ensuring your legacy continues\". But when you approach someone who you aim to start a family with, you're explicitly told in a pop-up message that your kid won't actually get to grow up and do adult things until an update that comes later. They'll be eternally stuck as children in the meantime. This game is seriously called Sengoku Dynasty when there is no such dynasty to be found in 1.0. Here's the Merriam-Webster definition of \"dynasty\": \n\n1\n: a succession of rulers of the same line of descent \na dynasty that ruled China for nearly 300 years\n2\n: a powerful group or family that maintains its position for a considerable time\nborn into a powerful political dynasty\na baseball dynasty\n\nSENGOKU DYNASTY? MORE LIKE... SENGOKU... THE-DYNASTY-ENDS-WITH-ME! The first definition definitely does not fit here, since you will be the ONLY ruler with no such role being passed to your children because they will be babies forever. Ironically, the second definition actually does fit because you will be ruling for an ETERNITY! You could sleep tens of years away in this game and the only thing different would be the ever increasing size of your stockpile. Seasons will change, years will pass, but no one will age, no NPC towns will grow, and resources will stay plentiful. It's like the whole world is inside a time bubble. Your town will steadily grow each year... and the first villager you recruited in year 1 will still be alive to witness you welcoming villager 274 in year 102. Your kid will still be a baby, too. This really adds to my whole robot comparison.\n\nDid I mention that villagers can't have their own babies? If you want new villagers, you have to manually scour the world for people that magically appear every season. They're all robots, I tell you.\n\nBesides the \"Dynasty\" part being incomplete, another missing feature slated for LATER is enemy raids. Despite this, my people will still desire \"security\", aka another number for the robots to consume. Why should I, as a player, care about the security of my automatons when I KNOW there is no real threat? That feature is coming later guys, you don't need protection!\n\nCombat is also disappointing. Enemies can only see a few meters, but hey, at least they have 360 degree vision. Enemies don't aggro as a group either, just inch into an enemy's vision circle (not cone) so you can pick them off one by one. Spears also make this game super easy; just take one step back, press attack, and the enemy will walk right into the hitbox because enemies can only walk straight at you (which also gets them stuck on obstacles). To compare this combat to something like Dark Souls would be an insult to actual good games (I'm looking at you, other reviewers). \n\nWhat I've written about is just annoyances that I could come up with off the top of my head. There is more I could write about if I opened the game again and dug a bit deeper, but I'd rather not see this game again for another year or two or three. The most fun I had with this game was thinking about my android peasants being stuck in time for an eternity, aka writing this review. \n\nBasically, this game has no personality and shouldn't be in 1.0. It's objectively unfinished and they can't even bother to act like it's done. It's amateurish slop.",

            "review": "The so called \"release\" is abysmal. Months in development, and it barely even changed. Post-launch? You barely even moved 2 segments of the original roadmap and then MAGICALLY decide to call it ver 1.0? You literally don't even have the stated core mechanics in your original developer dialogue and you wanna call the game ver 1.0? Fking seriously!?\n\nCharacter customization is rock bottom. Barely any variance in how you look. NPC variation is also abysmal, they literally are identical in terms of hairstyles and clothing type.\n\n\"Combat\" is literally the WORST part of the game. They added in Sekiro parry mechanics, but the enemy hitbox and attack data is so horrendous that visually the attacks don't sync up with the parry windows. Meaning you get hit BEFORE the strike even connects with you, and add in a lock-on system with GOD AWFUL movesets, and its a fking recipe for disaster. Your first move will be guaranteed to whiff an enemy literally LOCKED ON RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.\n\nThen you'll think to cheese ranged combat? Guess what? They can't even code the projectile to hit properly. If you're on even ground, you can pretty much guarantee a spear headshot onetap. Difference in elevation? You literally throw the spear, it hits the fker RIGHT IN THE HEAD, and the game treats it like a BODY SHOT!?\nMULTIPLE TIMES this shit occurs, and thats even taking into account the projectile spread. YOU LITERALLY SEE THE FKING THING HIT THE HEAD, but it doesn't count. The game literally gives you a projectile arc indicator... and it will still whiff. Worse is that you can throw a spear at closer ranges and the game DOESN'T register the oneshot.\n\n1.0 release? You fking kidding me? The bloody FOXES and HARES make the same noise as A DEER. LITERALLY THE SAME SOUND FILE because they COPYPASTA-ed the AI behavior without changing the goddam entity sounds. This coupled with the sheer lack of polish, and Toplitz just spamming out dynasty games literally tells you the utter dogshit this segment of Toplitz is.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised that they are so scuffed internally that they are releasing fking PDFs as DLC. Like really? A FUCKING COOKBOOK DLC? JUST FIX YOUR GODDAM GAME.\nJesus christ, its been practically 2 years... all you did was add in a female character and a couple of mechanics. What the fk has the studio been doing apart from finding cooking recipes.\n\nSave your money. This isn't Sengoku Dynasty, this is a failed branch of medieval dynasty rejects playing around with a game editor...\nI honestly wish I didn't get this game. 80+ hrs with multiple restarts, game still feels trash and incomplete.",

There are enough now to satisfy you.\n\nI will explain what is good and bad for me in this game and what i hope for the future as well. \n\nGood:\n-Graphics 8/10\n-Pathing (different types fo road) 10/10\n-Vast variety of things to pick around 8/10\n-Beautiful world  10/10\n-Battle system enjoyable 8/10\n-Farming is fun  8/10\n-Building multiple villages 10/10\n\nThe Bad or could be better:\n-All Seasons are beautiful. All except winter... Unrealistic natural landscape without pathing just all painted white. with snowy furniture inside the house (it even snows sometimes) Even footsteps sounds like walking on rain\n-100 people in this valley and there are only 2 faces, 1 for male and female (i know they added some customization but...come on)\n-Building on the hills is problematic (this is a problem that shares with medieval dynasty, I would have hoped for some terraforming but not sure if that is in the cards. its sad when you found this really nice location and u cant build upon it. Or if your buildings are like a skyscraper of stairs) \n- Not real threat in the map or complexity.\n-Balancing issues. (uff a lot)\na) a boar is much much more dangerous than a guy with katana\nb) Some items are too easy to pile up while others need a lot of time to have access too.\nc) Too much money from bandits...either give less or make the bandits harder\nd) lack of story driven plots (they said they ll add this soon)\ne) too much copper, tin and iron lying around. Way too much.... whats the point of mines? \nz) Balance on tree material and production (adze is worthelss)\n\nLastly things i hope and wish for the future:\n\n-First of all i hope and wish for a more complex map with secrets to unfold and dangerous places to traverse\n-More engaging villagers too static with little animations\n-IMPORTANT: Bell towers should be able to increase their radius a bit with village growth. Not much just a bit...\n-Macaque monkeys :(\n-Places we can built our own hotsprings, ryoukan.\n-Pagodas, musicians, and theater (also porcelain and gold? not sure if they are in the game)\n- Be able to form our own ponds? (i know its a hard one)\n- Also rice farms on hills is quite tricky but would be wonderful to have\n\nThis starts to become a great game and it can become a masterpiece if you continue developing it.... Definetely a worth!",

            "review": "Very cool game - but falls apart for me at around the 10 hour mark - after I've liberated a few regions and have to repeat the process.\r\n\r\nHere's my take - \r\n\r\nSurprisingly well done combat with a variety of weapons. Not a great enemy variety though.\r\nVery good looking open world, but not given much reasons to explore it.\r\n\r\nMy main criticism is the progression and lack of conflict - progression is tied to \"liberating\" regions - taking out the enemy boss and building/fixing something there. This is cool the first two times you do it, but after that - it's basically the exact same thing but with tougher enemies, which only becomes more of a chore.\r\n\r\nSo if you liberate a portion of the map you get new crafting recipies that sort of guide you through the regions. This pushes you out of the immersion because they are just given to you from the game, not from in game or the game world. So they start to feel like busy work\r\n\r\nEnemies don't come to you - you come to them - so that again pushes you out of the game world. Liberate this region - that faces no threat from the guys you are supposed to take out.\r\n\r\nBut - I know that for some players village building is the top/key component and if you want to build your own Japanese village - I think you'll have a blast in this game for longer than me.\r\n",

            "review": "I am a solo player still early in the game (just liberated Sosogi), so can't really speak to late game or co-op. However I am having a lot of fun with this. I never played until 1.0 release, and for $24 this is really a dope game. \n\nBest way I can describe it: it's like a mini ghost of Tsushima (open medieval japanese world with exploration, settlements, bandit camps to conquer, and NPCs with their own stories, albeit on a smaller sacle), with deep village building (as expected from a Toplitz published game). \n\nPros:\n- The Peasant Kingdom premise is fun and interesting\n- The Devs seem genuinely invested in improving the game and responding to the community\n- The combat is surprisingly fun and satisfying, was not expecting that. It does not feel like an after thought.\n- The amount of Japanese cultural decor and aesthetics you can build in your village is really nice, and surely to please at least a western weeb audience (can't speak for what an actual Japanese would think, though based on comment sections I've translated, they seem positive. If you're Japanese and reading this, please comment letting me know what you think!)\n- They did a good job on all the little flavor dialogue throughout the game. All NPCs have a name and unique dialogue (nothing deep, but a few lines to make it feels just a bit more alive).  \n- Tons of flexibility in settings, allowing the player a fine degree of control over all the systems, speed of building, FOV, difficulty, etc.\n\n\nCons:\n- Generally moderate to severe level of jank throughout, but nothing too immersion breaking. They got the important stuff right.\n- In rare occasions, performance is a bit weird. I'm playing on a 4070ti, and every now and then I'll get weird screen stutters and frame jumps. Large villages can get laggy.\n- The inventory screen is a bit much, especially just starting out. after 8 hours i still am getting lost a bit with all the options and work stations\n- The village job management mechanics are satisfying when they work, but not always very intuitive\n\n\nOverall devs did a great job, and if you are a gamer who is patient with some cumbersome systems and jank, enjoy the medieval Japanese setting and the survival crafting genre, I'm confident you will enjoy this.\n\nI'm looking forward to progressing through the story and working on my village building skills, and exploring the relationship and other mechanics. I can already tell that even if there isn't much more than this, there is enough in the village building to get my money's worth.",

However, I believe the game is too reliant on the liberation of zones for progression. Most of the powerful upgrades, like the making of higher tier tools, some buildings like the Forge, and higher tier weapons and armour, are locked behind liberating zones. While it is an enjoyable mechanic and gives a sense of achievement, I think core progression should be done through the management of your settlement. Some players might wish to just build and expand their settlement, but combat is required to make any meaningful progress so that you don't have to grind forever. And if combat is required, you should be able to have other NPCs with you to aid you against some of the higher threat zones, where combat can get difficult. Also, please add mounts. There is so much travelling that mounts would be a great addition.\n\nOverall: I enjoy the game and it's in-depth management of the settlement, but core progression needs reworked to not be as reliant on zone liberation.",

I especially like the way they utilize Roman annotation to encourage a richer recognition of the pronunciations of words.\n\nThe passage of the seasons is really quite nice, and the anthological cycle gives the world a nice, lush feel. Of course, I would be happy to have ten times more plantable options - but one step at a time.\n\nThe game has already developed quite cataclysmically with the last couple of content updates, but I am very excited to see how rich it will become. I have not being following development, but I have relatively high hopes for a deeply customizable, and interactable world. I hope we get all kind of personal touches, like being able to dress individual villagers, or dye clothing ( or even paper walls and wooden beams? :P ), or dare I even imagine - designing and naming custom recipes with dynamic statistics based on the ingredients chosen?\n\nHowever the game evolves, it has started in fine form, and I enjoy it very much. With the potential for relaxation, creativity, [i]and[/i] action, as well as for both meticulous [i]and[/i] whimsical playstyles, the only thing you need ask yourself is whether you enjoy the world-crafting genre, or Medieval Japanese aesthetics... if you enjoy both, then this is a no-brainer.",

            "review": "For a 1.0 release, it's pretty buggy. I'm into the mid/late game and the cracks are really showing. I dealt with the very clunky combat up to the iron stage and it really feels bad the further you go. Enemies with knives are starting to bug out and spam attacks endlessly and are unaffected by parries entirely. The combat has boiled down to trading hits with knife enemies since their poise is seemingly infinite. \n\nParry timing is hit or miss on most enemies. Sometimes it works and sometimes you just get a block or just take damage even though you timed the parry perfectly. I had to really tune down the damage enemies could deal since the game likes to throw 3 enemies at a time at you, but the mechanics aren't built for it. Katana enemies will 2 shot you even though you are wearing heavy armor. The game is horribly balanced. \n\nSince production doesn't finish until the end of the day, the game does a horrendous synchronous update that causes the game to freeze for 10 seconds when the day ends. This is pretty trivial, but then the game drops frames into the sub 30's while the game is trying to catch back up. I'm only at Dynasty level 15 with 58 villagers and it's chugging this bad already. No amount of DLSS 3.5 can keep the frames up. My PC is no slouch either. \n\nVillagers are starting to unreliably complete their tasks each day now too. My smithy is only producing iron hammers in spite of having pickaxes, knives, Axes, etc. selected. I have checked and rechecked all materials are available and made sure all proper storage is available in the smithy, yet it won't produce anything else but hammers. \n\nThis game is probably going to need some more time in the oven before it's ready. $30 is a little steep given the state this game is in. Honestly, given this team was willing to slap a 1.0 on this game in this state, I wouldn't expect the above complaints to improve much.\n\nPC Specs:\ni9 12900k\nASUS RTX 4090 TUF\n64 gig DDR5",

            "review": "The game is fun if you like city building/management games with a small dose of action combat, leveling skill trees, and supply chain management.\n\nLet me be upfront and say that if you're coming from Medieval Dynasty, you might be disappointed. Its missing some features from there that people enjoyed. Less content overall for sure compared to that game. But there are still good things I think that make this game overall positive and worth the price. I do think it is valid to criticize their 1.0 release as being incomplete and missing big features such as enemy raiding and a full child/offspring system. But for the price it is worth it even now, and will only get better unless they abruptly stop development.\n\nPros:\nCity management is fun in my opinion.\nEnvironment is beautiful.\nMusic is good.\nLeveling skill trees are good and feel impactful.\nOverall Japanese theme is preserved throughout the game. No major immersion breakers.\nPulls resources from storage when building, so you don't have to keep running to and from storage to craft or build things (huge positive IMO).\n\nCons:\nCombat isn't great. Blocking/dodging can feel weird. Arrows don't connect or go through enemies sometimes.\nCan't sort things in management tab such as type of buildings, where they are located, unemployed vs employed workers, etc.\nCrashes galore when I played CoOp with a friend.\nSome minor glitches sometimes such as graphic artifacts or music just stopping for some time.\nCitizens feel souless or zombie-like. They wander around without saying anything and talking to them give you very generic dialogue. Not even sure they properly stick to their work stations throughout the day.\nCitizens all look the same because there are very few character models. Almost all the males have the same exact haircut.\nGame missing some key features like enemy raiding and child/offspring system. They are working on it, but it's not there yet.\n\nOverall I do think it's worth the price and it is fun. But I think it is reasonable to also wait a bit longer for some key features to come out before jumping in. Just don't expect this game to be or exceed Medieval dynasty, and you'll enjoy it.",

            "review": "Decent game with alright amount of content. \r\nThe major drawback for me is the repetitive nature of recruiting new members for your villages. You literally need to pray for RNG to spawn refugees near you. If you aren't lucky, the only alternative is running around the map for 20+ minutes to be able to find some or sleeping to progress to the next season for zone refreshes.\r\nThe resource management is a pain in the butt and the UI was completely bastardized to allow for console gameplay. It's very obvious that they changed the UI to let this game be played on console, without regard to how much this impairs a PC players ability to look at what your village is generating and consuming. The needs are balanced decently, but the bad resource management makes it difficult to understand what you need to build next or change production to.\r\nThe production system is basically a matter of selecting different recipes for your assigned worker to craft for you, which is great in theory but fails to be good in reality. The process of choosing a recipe is a mess because you can't see what your village is actively producing and consuming on other crafting jobs. \r\nThe processing is done all in a single batch at the end of the day, so you don't get incremental resource dropped into storage throughout the day. This means you'll end up having production of 100+ logs but no logs to build with for the day because the workers haven't deposited yet. This is another hurdle for managing the economy because there's a lot of guesswork needed to plan what resources you need vs what you already have.\r\nThere are massive performance issues related to changing seasons and work processing at the end of the day. There are framerate issues within a city with a lot of player buildigns and npcs. This game does not scale up very well, but that may be my own hardware limitation. I don't have a top of the line PC but that's no excuse for framerate drops and freezing with all low settings.\r\n\r\nOverall, I give this game a headache / 10.",

            "review": "This is a review of my experience with SD. I can be picky, and the more frustrated I get over something usually means I really like it and selfishly want it to reach full potential. So if you disagree with my opinion, just slap a jester and move on.\n\nI have gone back and forth during EA to play updates, and now with 1.0, I gotta say meh... It's so hard to say that because it's close to what I'm looking for but has a shallow feeling at times. I do like this game, and I paid $30 for it, so I'm not mad at the value. I'm disappointed because I think they could do a lot more with it, but the developer seems to be focused on adding more content and mechanics, whereas I believe village mechanics, the core gameplay, needs improving.\n\nFirst off, for you RP gamers, this game is not ideal for inner RP. The game systems will constantly snap you out of immersion. You need to try hard not to find the village lifeless if you are not looking to have 15-20+ people in a village. I had a village of 12, not a lot, I know, but I was really going for a small village. I had villagers who dance on the roof, walk way out into the wilderness, get stuck in a loop because of a boulder in their path, or chilling in a house they have no business being in. Its just a mess from an RP point; from a gamer standpoint, I can fast travel/sleep to fix a lot of villager issues and move on with my life, but I ask you all, in a game about villager management/building, should that not be the mechanic that gets perfected?\n\n-QoL!!!!\nHow in the heck are they talking about developing a new map when systems could be reworked? The UI is rough and bare. I'm sorry, but it is. For a game that's supposed to be about management (I think?) they offer very little information or control over it. I get frustrated every time I do something simple like assign a villager to a house because you have no way of identifying the house, which forces you to go one at a time or play musical beds to get people where you want. Something so trivial and simple not being put in makes me believe they WANT you thinking of the villagers as nothing more than a resource to be filled, nothing deeper than simply adding them to the village that's short on labor. On the topic of labor and jobs, holy cow, there are SO MANY positions to be filled! You need someone just to pick up water from the well, move it to a box next to it, and that's it! That is their whole existence. I need to feed heat and sleep this dude just so I got someone to grab water. Yes, I can grab the water myself, but considering I have to do everything else in this management game, Id like the ability to have villagers that can mentally handle doing something like getting water from the well when a recipe needs it. I did not encounter odd bugs, only one CTD, and it was during an alt-tab'n so no complaints. \n\n-Gameplay\nReally fun the first village playthrough, but I can't see myself replaying full playthroughs with It's limited depth unless mod support happens. 1.0 motivated me to play, and I love the combat. Im a builder, so going in, I DGAF about combat, nor did I have faith that this lovely Janky game would execute it well, but I was wrong! Combat is smooth-ish (still playing GoT, so im trying not to judge on a curve). The stikes and sounds are great, and the animations are smooth unless you spaz with the mouse. The AI is still walking up sides of cliffs or doing small circles in the woods, but I'm not sure if that's a bug. This has happened since I got the game, so if it's not fixed yet, then it's a feature, not a bug. \n-Village Locations\n(Disclaimer: I am very picky with base/house placement in games TBF, and \"good\" is highly subjective.)\nIn my mind's eye, I had this idea of a small mountain village next to a stream with multiple levels and tons of trees. I learned quickly that wasn't happening. There are so many places in this game that I thought were beautiful and wanted to build, but sadly and not surprisingly, they were locations that were taken by the new bandit camps or existing towns. They built wonderful unique environments around towns as well as the bandit areas and, in my opinion, went vanilla in player build areas. The theme seemed to just be large, flat space. Its still beautiful, and I'm trying not to type negative here but really look around the towns and bandit areas, then visit the areas that can actually host a larger village, and you will notice it missing what I don't have the right words to describe. The game seems to want you to build big towns in order to progress, like its bigger and bigger and not better and more efficient. The whole gameplay loop is chop wood, build a big ass shack with 5 different redundant storages and a table that does the actual function of the building, chop wood, unlock a recipe needing 1 mat from an entirely second building with 5 redundant storages, chop wood, and do quests asking you to craft something that requires 3 buildings with 5 redundant storages each.\nThe Village Buildings\nBuilding exteriors look cool and very RP-friendly, but the build grid is difficult if you want to make them match up to create walkways. So if you are trying to build a village like the premade ones, then good luck and bless your patience. Interiors are drab, but it was the time after all, so I'm good with the look. I just absolutely loathe the multiple redundant storages that the AI doesn't even interact with. \n\nI DO like this game, and I did get my money's worth, and I will continue playing my coastal RP village from time to time in the hopes that further refinement goes into the game. I'll admit some of my issues with the game are created from what the game is not, which might not be the fairest way to review something. The Road map however, paints a picture of they are happy with the state of the game and are now ready to add more, so if thats the case, it's a bummer. ",

I would wait for further updates in this regard. Crafting is simple and nicely done with resources easy to locate and acquire. The fighting feels smooth and easy to master if your used to similar titles. I like the Job system that is in place but still getting used to it for NPC's.\n\n\n\n\n[u][b] Graphics/Frames [/b][/u]\nGraphics are okay and looks well put together. My GPU didn't struggle on High. Got some decent fps 72. I don't like the character models its disappointing.\n\n\n\n\n[u][b] Progression [/b][/u]\nBuilding your village is good and having wandering NPC's come and join your Cause is great I have not yet took over Bandit territory so I will update this part. Upgrading character stats unlocks other areas in the skill tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n[u][b] Final Thoughts [/b][/u]\nCharacter creation is what possessed me to buy this game although its based in the 15th and 16th century there were a lot of Darker skin toned warriors and this game does not give you that. Also there were many hairstyles with hair accesories like ribbons or headbands and head garbs. This game lacks that. The depth of character creation needs more love is what i am trying to say but everything else is well put together.\n\n\n[u][b] Rating out of 5 [/b][/u]\nI give the game a 3.5 because it needs more love in the character creation side of things. It is okay but not great and also things like scars are not the best i wanted an X on the cheek on its own but had to have it with a scar on the nose. no actual freedom to place the scars. There is no freedom in the character creation this is my only criticism.",

            "review": "Sengoku Dynasty - Promising, But Not Ready Yet\n\nI’ve put in about 25 hours into Sengoku Dynasty, and while the game starts off with some promise, I can’t recommend it in its current state. It’s technically out of Early Access, but honestly, it feels like it’s still in development — especially when it comes to multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer is Rough:\nThe multiplayer experience is extremely laggy, and that’s being generous. I’m running a high-end PC (RTX 4090, Ryzen 3900X, 128GB RAM), and the performance is still awful. The game constantly struggles to keep up, and enemies often just wander around aimlessly without attacking. You can hit them like they’re ragdolls, and it feels more like you’re testing a broken demo than playing an actual game.\n\nFPS Issues:\nOnce you start raiding the Ronin camps, the FPS drops to unplayable levels (2-8 FPS). It’s hard to focus on combat when the game is struggling to even render the action. Enemies are nearly impossible to hit, and the lag makes it all frustrating rather than fun.\n\nCity Building is the Highlight:\nThe city-building mechanics are decent and the most polished part of the game. You can create and manage a village, and it’s enjoyable as long as you can look past the other issues. But unfortunately, that’s where the positives end.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nSengoku Dynasty has a lot of potential, but it feels unfinished and unpolished right now. If you’re hoping for a stable multiplayer experience or smooth gameplay, you’ll be disappointed. SINGLE PLAYER IS FINE THOUGH! The city-building is solid, but the game needs a lot of work to make it enjoyable overall. I’d recommend waiting at least 2-3 years for updates, assuming the devs continue to improve it. Hopefully by then, it’ll be worth playing.",

            "review": "TL;DR\nI cannot recommend this game at the normal price. There are too many bugs and too few QoL features for being a version 1.0. I still experience crashes at times as well.\n\nThis game has some things going for it. Most of them are the similarities to Medieval Dynasty. But where it should be better, it is not. Why are there still so many games without a lot of QoL features? Why can't I hold a button to transfer a whole stack? I need to drag and drop for that?! And why are arrows so bugged? If an enemy is killed, all arrows hit a wall of air where he was last standing... they also don't stay on an enemy, except for the last one. Have fun searching... The AI bugs out at times as well and their bodies sometimes bug out and are barely visible. Also a grid for placing structures would be great (though they have one for the inner spaces, which is nice). Also don't expect a lot of armor/clothing combinations. basically only some head, foot and main gears.\n\nBut let's get to the good points:\nI like the liberation system\nMany skills make it a little more of an RPG\nParrying actually works OK\nFast travelling to some villages\n\nOverall? \nBuy if it is on sale. Maybe 15 Euros for this game in its current state. I will continue playing but also rage at times.",

Try running without the -dx12 or -d3d12 command line argument.\"\n\nI installed this game on two separate laptops. One running Windows 11, and the other still Windows 10. Both computers are currently using DirectX 12 Ultimate. It won't play on either one. I've tried without the commands, I've verified the files, I've updated Steam, and I've updated my GPU, and still nothing. And yes, I made sure I met system requirements before purchasing, like any good gamer does. I've been looking forward to this release, and have never had this issue with any other game on either computer. Far more intensive games utilising DX 12 run just fine. After searching the internet and other reviews for this game, it seems there is no fix forthcoming. So, given all the negative reviews after the release of 1.0, and the fact that I cannot even log IN to Sengoku Dynasty, I will be pursuing a refund for the gift-giver, because this is nonsense. And there will likely be no second chances here. Not for at least a year, and not unless I see some significant improvement in the reviews.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue, and if so...have you figured out what to do about it?",

            "review": "[h1] A Positive But Scathing Review: Decent With BIG Caveats [/h1]\n\nThis game has potential. I actually enjoy playing and wish the studio the best. However, a lot of things are ill-optimized or buggy. For example, dropped rotten food doesn't despawn after (sometimes) restarting and hours in game, a common computationally saving measure in many games. While trivial as a benefit for freeing memory, I understand not implementing it because of complexity of making a garbage collector--but I suspect a rush to core features is present in other parts of the game as well. The game right now is okay, and coming from M&B as a modder and almost lifelong player, I seriously hope these guys succeed with this title so that it doesn't stay this mediocre. \n\nThe roadmap addresses some shortcomings of the game as it is. However I'd compare this game to Bannerlord while it was still in Early Access. As a 1.0 release this is kind of lacking. \n\n[h2] What it Does Well: [/h2]\nThis title brings some pretty cool things to the table, but nothing industry-pioneering. This is essentially a thematically consistent version of Conan Exiles with more extensive village management and more cookie-cutter buildings. It brings the quintessential single player experience--something always-online games lack. I like this over Conan Exiles for exactly this reason. The cookie cutter buildings reduces complexity while also bringing a nice custom experience to gameplay. \n\nCombat is somewhat satisfying. It mixes a lot of good things from different games, but is fundamentally almost Dark Souls like. There is also custom difficulty settings, which is always welcome. This game also has a nice perk system. This games brings a bunch of awesome features from other games into one.\n\n[h2] Critiques: Oh Boy... [/h2]\nThings aren't fully implemented. There is a \"Daimyo\" system, and they have only recently implemented 14-15th century Samurai armor as well as respective weapons, which is comical that anyone played this before this update as this would've been more accurately \"Peasant Kingdom\" than \"Sengoku Dynasty\" prior to this release. Furthermore, [b] there is no currently implemented follower mechanics [/b]. You are literally just roaming around everywhere by yourself, with no army or force to speak of, cheesing camps of sometimes 20 combatants. You are nowhere close to being a \"Daimyo\" let alone some sort of \"Sengoku\" character.\n\nQuests and the world is kind of... meh. Interfacing with NPCs is essentially reading walls of text. You aren't particularly compelled to be immersed in the open world. In comparison to something like Kingdom Come: Deliverance this is almost amateurish in world building. This feels lackluster in comparison, but I still recommend this game because it is so difficult to design and implement and hope they improve.\n\nThe way they implemented security as well is...meh. You can give them weapons, but they essentially don't do much and stand around looking busy. They also keep their refugee clothes while using high-end weapons, while having high-end armor just sitting in storage. You don't feel like a \"Daimyo\" with a samurai army in \"Sengoku\" Japan as much as you are a heavily armored babysitter.\n\n[b] Performance is also incredibly surprising in a bad way. This game chugs along and drops frames for a pretty minimal benefit-to-cost. [/b]\n\nThis game also has so much marketing material that I'd wish they spent those man-hours on game development. \n\nTheir promotional video talks about \"supporting Sengoku Dynasty long after release\". Arguably this is not a finished game. Other studios like Taleworld have somewhat dropped the ball by releasing a barebones game--a mistake that has costed them their reputation, and one I hope this studio does not replicate.\n\n[h2] Wishlist: [/h2]\n[list]\n   [*] A follower system to properly play as a \"Daimyo\"\n   [*] Performance optimization\n   [*] A more dynamic map/combat \n   [*] More strategy elements for combat and map dynamics\n   [*] Extended cosmetics--Sengoku era samurai often had clan-specific crests (kamon). \n   [*] Steam Deck support\n   [*] More free-flowing decision making (i.e. being able to fight friendly NPCs or play as a bandit)\n[/list]\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\nHonestly an okay title if it improves. A lot of great things and core features available. An offline-available single player experience. However, it [b] REALLY [/b] needs to be improved on.",

It is very hard to play (release candidate also may crashes for me but not so often). In EA, you could get iron easily - in release version it  requires  a lot of grind which is a sign of boring gameplay for me. Trade is awful, in EA you could buy items,  in current verion it is useless because of not fair difference between buy and sell prices. Conquest and combat also strange for me: why need to conquest a region to get a knife scheme? Land surface sometimes blinking, geometry of landscape also may cause inconvenient, especially,  during combat. Bird nests inside a water stream are ridiculous.\n\nAfter last update, there is crash but sometime have a freeze.\n\nI hope that the game will become more stable and iteresting in new releases.",

The inventory system is better than Medieval Dynasty but it still fells like you spend a lot of time back tracking to one of your villages to pick up supplies for any of the special projects. One thing I do enjoy over Medieval Dynasty is that you don't have to craft dishes and table ware in order to cook food recipes. Still both the crafting and resourcing systems feel like a really big chore. One example is straw, I haven't found a building that makes it so I am constantly having to come back and spend a lot of time processing grass into straw so I can have enough around for the fishermen to make nets.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the effort the DEV's have put into the game and I understand its a sand box game with an emphasis on building and crafting, would it kill them and every other DEV to put some sort of resource chart in the game so we can all figure out what resources we need villagers producing and in what quantities to maintain everything? for example if I'm not producing enough planks, have an indicator somewhere that shows the gross number of planks my woodworkers are producing and then next to it how many planks I need per day to maintain production of all of the goods that need planks. This would help players figure out how to assign production so they are not constantly running back to a village to fix a raw material shortage.",

Combat is also surprisingly fun; better than I expected with some fun parry mechanics and random encounters that, even if they are simple, can feel tense and rewarding. I'd some it up as \"What you'd expect as good as you can expect\" so if you want to play this style of game in a sengoku setting then this is great!",

Its actually so cool, that it saved the survival genre for me, as they are mostly simple boring games out there.\n\nIn this game, you can decide what you want to do, and assign others to do what you don't want to do. Friendly start of the game and added bonus of cool historical meaning and feudal Japan.\n\nThere is a calm, steady pace of the game, that naturally goes by, unintrusive quests that encourage you to explore but don't pressure or give you no other choice. It's all up to you, but in a controlled environment, which doesn't feel like the \"I'm lost\" sandbox type, but more like \"here are your choices, you decide what you want to do\" way. The game has a simple enough UI so you know what you have to do, and important new things have an explanation prompt. \n\nThe fact that you can specialise in different \"ways\" and make your farming/hunting/leading/spiritualism more efficient is very cool and sets it apart from other survival games.\n\nOne of the best purchases I've done on Steam and the best survival I've played out there and better than the big names (like Valheim and co).\n\nRECOMMEND!!!!",

I love the whole civilization-building angle. Instead of being on your own like most survival games, you are creating an entire town, then multiple towns, then a kingdom. The gameplay and the ancient Japan setting really makes it feel fresh. The game also feels very well balanced, if just a tad grindy.\n\nBut let's be honest... despite being balanced and fun, and despite the developers calling this \"1.0\", it's still VERY MUCH early access material. It crashes a lot. It does feel balanced, but it's still unnecessarily grindy. You can't invite or join friends via Steam, you have to share an \"invite code\" manually. It's also not always clear what the game wants from you in order to progress... and sometimes the things it wants don't really make logical sense. The management UI is clunky and awful. The ultrawide support is broken due to the FOV sliders not having high enough values (21:9 is fine, but 32:9 will make you physically ill). The performance is also really questionable for how bleh the graphics are. I know it's UE, but it looks like Unity... it doesn't look as good as the official videos. I'm not sure why that is. It feels unfinished.\n\nBut then again... it's only thirty bucks, and it's genuinely fun. I hope we get the polish that the game deserves, because it really is a fresh mix. Great ideas, fun, decent combat, even... it should just still be in early access, is all.",

            "review": "If you're coming from MD and hoping for a MD experience in Japan, this is going to be hit and miss. Sengoku offers numerous unique systems (such as liberating regions, combat*, and the obvious Japanese aesthetic) and enough familiar ones that those who have played similar games can more or less dive right in. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of those more unique systems feel very anemic to the point of being annoying. Combat for example recently underwent an extensive overhaul but the result was something I low key wish wasn't even there (and this is someone who loves combat in these games). It's overly simplistic, easy to cheese even when you're not trying to, and the AI is... well, not great. Unfortunately in order to progress in this game you MUST engage with it, so there's no real ignoring it. \n\nWhereas MD has many interlocking systems that are dependent on one another, Sengoku's feels both convoluted and flat. For example, there are many, MANY kinds of storage types, from food to wood to general and more; the thing is, you don't actually need anything other than the general storage, and your people will pull from that storage for all their needs which makes everything else at best redundant and at worst useless despite the other storage types being locked behind technology and such.\n\nVillagers are also incredibly simplistic. There are no more stats or preferences, anyone can do anything at any time and be juts as efficient as anyone else. This might not matter to some but it really snaps you out of the immersive feeling of being in a living settlement. To add to that, there are very, VERY few actual animations the villagers will do throughout the day which just lends to that 'dead' feeling. For some reason the devs seem to have acknowledge that early on and added special 'furniture' you can buy that the villagers will 'work' at to display a little more life, which seems like an odd workaround but I digress.\n\nIt's not a bad game, and it's getting a thumbs up from me, but compared to MD (which is both unfair and understandable) it just seems a bit flat. It's a solid foundation though, and it's worth getting in my opinion.",

My pc is not by any measure underpowered, running most modern games on medium/high settings in 1080p, but this game, after building a sizeable village and having over 50 people, cannot even touch 30FPS on all the lowest settings while looking at the ground.\n\nI recommend this game if you are confident your pc can handle the dogwater optimisation, otherwise, i would probably steer clear.",

            "review": "Huge disappointment.\n\nCompared to Medieval Dynasty, the game offers more enjoyable village automation, but you are continuously frustrated by the stupid game progression design. It turns out that access to advanced resources requires having numerous villages. The main quest caps the number of villages, and it advances very slowly. If you could hire new villagers whenever you want, the main quest could go more quickly, but of course, that is not possible. You must look for them in the wilderness in random locations throughout the seasons, unlike the Medieval Dynasty, when you could hire them in any village. To obtain two to three villagers per season, you must traverse the entire map. Which is the speed of the sail. Because of this, my population cap is constantly higher than the actual population count. It's just artificial bull crap limitation.  \n\nOther than village count cap and constant lack of villagers, you have to unlock regions. And boi its mess on whole other level. You need to build notable buildings to unlock regions. You need to assign villagers to build notable buildings. The severe shortage of villagers forced me to reassign villagers from food production. This doesn't count as village automation in my mind if I have to change jobs every season.\n\nAnd if you do unlock a region with higher quality resources, pay attention because a building that can process these resources is unlocked in a different region at the other end of the map.\n\nThere are too many mechanics that limit your advancement and none that reward you for trying to actually play the game.",

            "review": "I give this a \"soft\" thumbs down. Interesting concept of a game: a kingdom simulator, but first person. Sadly though, the sim mechanics are pretty shallow. I wasn't expecting \"X4: Foundations\" levels of depth, but even then this is pretty shallow. The villagers just magically make resources appear by standing around in their buildings. And you, and only you, can build the village buildings. The villagers do very little, they're more like set pieces, and the world doesn't feel very real or deep. For me, it makes the game feel kind of rudderless; after a few hours of play, you've seen the gist. Part of the joy of sim games is discovering deep mechanics, and emergent behavior that comes with it.\n\nThe combat is decent, probably one of the more polished parts of the game. Everything else though feels \"jank\" and unfinished. I had to double check if this was an early-access game or not! Even little things are wrong: sometimes you just _cant_ swing a tool (yes, you read that right) in situations where you should be able to. If you are in a menu and an in-game notification fires, the entire menu stack gets messed up, replacing letters and graphics, forcing you to close and reopen (hope you weren't busy with something). Inventory just disappears when put in the \"village storage\" (hours of grind wasted). \n\nThe game is grind-y too; long distance fetch quests, low resource yield for lots of time spent, tools breaking with little use, village buildings locked behind a _slow_ XP accumulation gate.\n\nTo wrap up: I probably would have returned this if I wasn't 6 hours in. Assuming the devs don't abandon it, I'll give it a try in the future. As is now though, this is not a complete game.",

I can't really ask much more from a progression based game. I haven't yet played it all but of course a game should always thrive to be better.

They complained it wasnt possible because of Unreal Engine, lol I know thats false. However thats not why I am giving it a thumbs down. The game now has bugs that dont let you progress in Solo, and Crashes you in Co-op. Solo the bridge ( First one ) just lingers in complete mode but still shows you havnt completed it, where before the recent update it worked fine. CO-OP it just crashes when you try to fast travel, or when you move from one menu to another.... Its a mess. Im sure they can fix it. \n\nUntil they do Im not going to encourage anyone to buy a game thats currently BROKEN",

You can still get stuck on the environment all over the place. They cycled out a bunch of stuff (like gloves) but left the equipment slot, so you have a slot you can never fill. The kitchen has a big pot cooking station that no longer works, with zero explanation as to why. None of the shrine blessings have tool tips to tell you what they do. Bows are absolutely useless. And that's just the gameplay, plenty of people are experiencing constant crashes too.\n\nThis game absolutely has potential to be great, but it's just not there yet. I've given it an honest shake, but it's a few major updates away from being worth spending your money on.",

The village management part isn't really great,  it's downright tedious most of the time and you can't customize your villagers or have them work multiple jobs (needing someone assigned to just draw water from the well is weird) But the combat is pretty fun once you learn the mechanics. \n\nI recommend turning the beverage and healing needs of your villagers down to about 30% if you want the village simulation thing to not absolutely frustrate you. Not only does the well require a worker like I mentioned previously but it only produces about 600 beverage, if you just make 10 buckets when you wake up, drop em down the well, and pick them up to store before you go to bed it's 2500. Meaning you are basically shoehorned into doing a task yourself since even 4 NPCs working wells couldn't compare to you manually doing it. And the majority of healing items are locked behind a late-game region, meaning you're pretty much forced to only use healing brew which requires 2 full-time foragers to assist with, so its 3 NPCs making only about 400 healing, and starting out my village was 18 NPCs and they required 800+ healing a day.",

            "review": "Dont bother.\nThis is a total piece of rubbish.\nEvery single system is badly programmed, unfinished, and likely to be a 'worst in class'.\nThe inventory is terrible. The ability to switch items in your hotbar is terrible.\nThe combat is buggy. You will get stuck on the interface and the game will refuse to fire your arrows.\nThe deep water is instant death. You drown quicker than a hollywood movie.\n\nBasically, they have a great setting, some very nice graphics - and then they punish you every moment you play.\n\nI played it for a bit, but I ended up frustrated every few minutes with something that the designers should either have fixed, never started with, done the same way as every other quality game, or just spent three seconds thinking about before they created a crappy solution to an already solved problem.\n\nAbsolutely the worst implementation I have ever had the misfortune to play.\n\n[EDIT]\nPlayed again after they fixed a few things. So I knew what I was getting into the second time.\nI hear that the devs call this a 'village simulator' rather than an RPG. I'm not thrilled by that idea, but let's take it on board and examine.\nIs it a village simulator? No. You build things, sure. But your villagers are not simulated. They are just a set of numbers for production and consumption. And if that is the case, then surely there are systems to help you manage production and consumption. Again, sadly, no. Everything is hidden behind some 'interesting' design and interface choices. Or to be more honest, some worst-in-class screens and layouts. Nothing here is simple, nothing is made clear to you, and there are no consolidated stats as you might expect. And even if there were, it would just be a spreadsheet focused on the least interesting part of the game IMO.\n\nThe best part of the game is the world, and expanding your knowledge of places and what you can build and grow. This will occupy your actual brain time. Not the village, or at least only in steps as you add a new refugee, tell them what to do, and then forget them forever.\nIf that is the case, the devs have indeed created an RPG. And it is actually quite good at this. But without quests and personalities, you are stuck with gated adventuring and combat situations that lead towards new areas.\n\nCombat though, just sucks. Absolutely sucks. I'm not overstating that it is without doubt the most bug ridden useless piece of junk ever released. In theory, the one to one combat has nuance and flair. But the ranged attacks are god awful, the enemy pathing is abysmal, and I'm running out of bad words to use. Truly terrible. Never should have been released, and I would be ashamed as a dev to say that it is in a 'release 1.0 state' at all.\n\nSo where does it go from here? I could imagine new expansion lands, new items to build, new crops to grow (and god help us because seasons for your crops is an exercise in self-abuse for the player). This would all be pointless because it wouldn't address the real challenges.\n\nCan they fix combat? Sure. Everybody else has. Lets assume they can too.\nCan they make the village management better? The screen redesign would be in theory very simple and helpful and add some overall statistics. \nBut. \nYes, that's a standalone statement. I'm just feeling that the devs are in love with their own interface and had it developed by separate sub-teams who just didn't talk or share with each other. So I'm betting the answer here is actually a hard 'no'.\nCan they introduce personalities and quests? What would be the point in this and how would it work with the other things so sadly lacking. Not clear how this would make it better, or fit thematically.\n\nAnd now for the good bit(s). The game is absolutely beautiful. The visuals are at least an eight out of ten. Building your buildings is fun for a while and rewarding in a repeated-clicking manner. But after a time, its just make-work. If you have a whole bunch of cool stuff available, make it have an impact. Make your village impossible to build without paying attention to detail. But then illuminate those details to the player. That would be extremely cool, and in keeping with the style. To make this a great village simulator, with complex systems, they need to be intelligible without a spreadsheet. Help us envision that. Force us to make beautiful and functional homes, and to husband those scarce resources to best effect. Give me easy ways to create repeat buildings, and let me focus on the new stuff and making everything individualised (with game impact driven by it).\n\nAnd for god sake, take away the stamina bar. Sure, in combat would be fine. But everywhere else, just ditch it. Hosing your own game is never smart.\n\nWould I buy it again? On special, yes, absolutely. But it is a one-and-done game. And there was a lot of swearing, and an awfully large amount of 'why the hell did they do it that way' discussion. Not in a positive light, to be clear. The pretty graphics made it liveable, but I would not recommend it with the flaws. They are too deep, and too obvious. If they were going to be fixed, they would already be fixed. So this one is on a pathway downwards unless there is a change at the helm.",

The base/city building is very fun by itself but also having RPGesque elements like quests and perk trees, it's been an overall, really great time.\r\n\r\nThe Combat itself could use a little tweaking but i'm confident the dev team will polish it more further down the road.

I played Medieval dynasty and I am one of those who did not enjoy it fully despite trying it again multiple times and getting bored quickly. \n\nSengoku Dynasty makes the world feel more alive, It's hard to describe how exactly but it feels like more than a grindy village builder. Oh and talking about grind, it also feels less grindy and farming resources for building felt more enjoyable.\n\nI'll come back to update the review after more playtime. If you like me did not fully enjoy Medieval dynasty there is a chance you might like this one.\n\nEdit after 10h: The game falls into the same thing as Medieval did, which is to feel a bit pointless at some point. I still feel like I got more out of Sengoku than I did in medieval. But my village is happy as is, and I don't feel a pull toward growing it more. All villagers look exactly the same with maybe 2 or 3 different models, are all females which is fine by me but still is a bit unrealistic, and there is not much interaction to be had with them. Killing a few animals and gathering myself for 2 minutes is enough to feed them forever too.",

Even the story has some interesting points, with little moral choices at the end of quests. I appreciate how the developers show care for their game and listen to the community; for example, combat, character progression with traits for different classes, and character customization were very welcome additions. The only thing I think could be improved is the option to customize the third-person camera's X and Y axes (I’d love to put it always over the shoulder with this feature). Overall, great work, I’ll be spending endless hours making offerings to the Kami, exploring, and tending to the fields! ^^",

The map is huge so I found myself running around for it again, found it... and the season reset, which means you get forced back to camp to sleep. What a horrible mechanic. suffice to say, the game is not user friendly for those new to these type of building games and I do not recommend due to confusing mechanics to crafting and quality of life.

But the combat is Souls-lite, crafting recipes and workstation requirements are sensible, and progression feels rewarding. \n\nThere is this one thing you need to do, though: Make certain building pieces snap-able to each other. Seriously, right now you can't even make the traditional Japanese style mansion where a series of walkways and houses form into a square, because nothing can align with one another. It is beyond frustrating. This negative stays here until this is addressed, for a game that I otherwise very much like.",

However, I have zero tolerance for homophobia in the 2024 video game industry. The 1.0 launch added NPC romance which I've looked forward to for a long time, and it's incredibly upsetting that they today stated they've exclusively added \"opposite-gender romance\" in the patch notes. This comes across as intentionally exclusionary, not to mention homophobic. I understand the   argument that gay marriage was not legal in the historical context that the game takes place, however that is simply an excuse that allows people to feel more comfortable being homophobic and exclusionary. Even if gay marriage is not legal, or gay romance is culturally frowned upon today in Japan, the game is being marketed to the world/USA audiences and therefore should be designed in a way that is inclusive. \n\nDeleting this game from my library.",

Its immersive setting and unique blend of mechanics are sure to provide hours of fun for those drawn to this theme.\r\n\r\nHowever, one glaring disappointment with the 1.0 release is the barebones character creation. With only three hairstyles, three faces, and three beard options, it feels like a missed opportunity to let players fully immerse themselves in the world. I sincerely hope future updates expand these options, including body types, additional hairstyles, and more customization to match the depth of the game's concept.",

I appreciated that each building has a distinct pre-designed look that reflects its function—a small house, for instance, has a unique appearance compared to a hunting lodge, and the water storage differs visually from the food storage.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3222217662\n[b] Customization[/b]\nThis design is similar to traditional city builders, where buildings are easily recognizable by their appearance. However, Sengoku Dynasty adds a twist by offering customization options. During construction, you can choose the type of wood for each panel, altering the exterior look. You can also select wall options—no window, small window, large window—and even add extra entrances for different access points to the building.\n\n\n[h1] Multiplayer[/h1]\n[*]🔸 Sengoku Dynasty's multiplayer mode has a lot of promise. While the server selection screen is quite simple at the moment, with limited information such as only the world name and player count, it still offers a chance to experience the game together. \n\n[*]🔸 Playing with friends who have a good connection can provide a smoother experience, and once the multiplayer system is further developed and refined, it could become a fantastic feature that enhances the game's cooperative aspects, offering more opportunities for teamwork and shared exploration. With some improvements, it has the potential to be a great addition to the game..\n\n\n[h1] Establishing Your Dynasty [/h1]\n[*]🔸 As my Dynasty level increases in Sengoku Dynasty the game opens up with new buildings and crafting options. However, there aren’t enough features to keep my interest during the slower periods between each level. The village management systems feel basic so far, with only a few resources to manage, like food and water. Some aspects aren’t very clear, such as how to maintain your villagers' happiness.\n\n[*]🔸 According to developer Superkami, there are many exciting features planned for *Sengoku Dynasty*, such as marriage, children, player aging, an expanded combat system, new weapons, and new enemies. As of yesterday, the game received its first major update, fixing numerous bugs and improving tool durability, among other enhancements. It's refreshing to see such transparency and communication from the developers, especially \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3331920927\n\n\n[h1] Soundtracks🎶 [/h1]\n[*]🔸 The soundtrack of *Sengoku Dynasty* beautifully complements its feudal Japan setting, adding depth to the immersive experience. Traditional Japanese instruments like the shakuhachi and koto create a serene, atmospheric backdrop that enhances the game’s relaxing, contemplative tone. The music subtly shifts to match different environments and activities, from village building to exploring scenic landscapes, giving players a sense of calm and focus. While the soundtrack is generally understated, it’s carefully crafted to avoid becoming repetitive, making it a soothing and fitting companion for long gameplay sessions. Overall, the music is a strong element that enriches the game’s ambiance and immersion.\n\n\n[b] Here are a few highlights of Sengoku Dynasty:[/b]\n\n[*]🔸 1. Unique Genre Blend: Combines survival crafting, city building, life simulation, and open-world RPG elements, offering a fresh and diverse gameplay experience.\n\n[*]🔸 2. Beautiful Artwork: The hand-drawn cutscenes and visual style are reminiscent of traditional Japanese ink paintings, adding immersion and depth to the narrative.\n\n[*]🔸 3. Customization: The crafting system allows for significant customization of buildings, from choosing wood types to adjusting window and entrance designs, giving players creative freedom.\n\n[*]🔸 4. Seasonal Gameplay: The game features an interesting seasonal cycle, with seasons lasting only 5 days, keeping the gameplay dynamic and fast-paced. Plus, the option to skip ahead after the second day adds flexibility.\n\n\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] In conclusion ⌛[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]*Sengoku Dynasty* delivers a unique, genre-blending experience that combines survival crafting, city building, and RPG elements. Its beautiful art style and creative customization options, along with the promise of exciting new features, make it a title to keep an eye on. The developers’ dedication to regular updates and attention to player feedback suggest that the game will keep evolving, providing a relaxing and immersive journey for players drawn to its feudal Japan-inspired setting.

Medieval Dynasty was good, Sengoku is incredible. The only negatives I can think of for now, are that it is too taxing for my own PC, so I have to play at someone else's place for the time being (or resorting to Medieval Dynasty instead for now) and the map seems pretty small (so far). I mean, I've had to travel nearly across the map several times now, and whenever I did, I could run it in an in-game day. In Medieval Dynasty (and other games, like Red Dead Redemption 2) it really feels more like you have to prepare for such a trip, and you need to camp out and pray you get home safely. So yeah, hopefully, the map will get a little bigger or it will turn out what I thought was the full map in reality is but a small section.",

I did click on \"No\" for the recommendation because I was not allowed to post my review without clicking either yes or no.  I wish there was another option.\n\nI know that the game is still in Early Access, but once you complete all quests, which for me took 3 or 4 years, the only thing left is to reach dynasty level 19.  the game gets kind of boring.\n\nThere are two things that really annoy me.  \n\nFirst, the aim and shoot process for shooting arrows.  While I can easily shoot foxes, trying to kill deer is really hard.  I think I've only killed a half dozen or so deer, while I've killed just as many bears, with a combination  of arrows and the spear, (sorry I forget what it's called).  Using the bow is not very user friendly.  The arc that you show makes it quite hard to get hits.  I wish you used the same mechanics for bow and arrow that you use in Medieval Dynasty.  That is much easier and I get way more direct head hits.\n\nThe second issue is with using the tab key to got to the Character/legend/Quests/Dynasty/Map screen.  I've been killed a few times when going to that screen because the game does not pause so while you can't defend yourself, you get attacked by different animals.  I wish it was like Medieval Dynasty where the game pauses when you are looking at that screen.",

Sometimes they even fling you across the map! I think thats the first time I smiled in the 45 hours leading up to this point.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend? Maybe. If you like collecting resources and putting them in a box, then seeing what you can make with them, Id say theres a few hours of enjoyment. It will at least keep your mind occupied.\r\n\r\nIts not bad. People walking into rocks for (in game) days is annoying. Only being 2 npc's all repeating the same old story is boring. I get it, there was hunger in your valley so you came here. Fine go join village D, with the other 15 hunger story people then il never talk to you again. Warriors never stood a chance? yup join the other 18 in village C.\r\n\r\nTheres not much thats actually bad. Its just nothing exciting. except getting flung by trees and that kills you. \r\n\r\nThe map kinda is hard to read\r\nThe inventory is frustrating since you cant see what you have to work with when assigning tasks\r\nTheirs no indication of what people actually use or are going to use except the resource being gone\r\nAnimals have no health bar, You can walk across water I guess all water in old japan was only waist deep?\r\n\r\nBut the world looks decent if pretty empty. Once you make work stations you dont really need the world though. anything you need your people gather, although they never leave the village. probably cause theyre stuck on a rock.\r\n\r\nWould i recommend? sure. But not if you want excitement of any sort. Except for mulberry trees (although theres a distinct lack of mulberries). 46 hours in, im heading out.",

To be honest, I find the characters homely in comparison to Medieval Dynasty.

I absolutely despise the hold X to do anything when you are trying to gather basic crap like sticks in crafting games, and SD manages to do it with most of it's loose materials. Add in the super slow animations and janky progression with combat mechanics straight out from early 2000's, you've got a bare bones demo with nice aesthetics, but they won't save this mess unless the devs put serious work hours into streamlining the gameplay, cutting away unneccessary bloat from building and farming systems as well as adding the option to press E in order to collect stuff, instead of artificially padding gameplay time by forcing players to hold a button down for a full second per shrub or mushroom cluster. Seriously, this kind of Ubisoft tier looting shit should be a bannable offense in 2024 and pointed out whenever it appears in any video game.",

Quite interestingly, the dialogue system is better than Medieval Dynasty's system.\r\n\r\nBoth games are good, but this one is not finished yet to warrant a buy, it will get you around 5-10 hours of content.",

I went from a ship wrecked survivor to a full blown samurai killer i slowly expanded my city not with just economic growth but by force in some cases. The deeper I went into this game the more I started to enjoy it at first it felt a bit like too much grinding but after I had finished the missions that were setup to explain the game play that's when it set me free to run.\n\nOnce we hit that milestone everything changed my village started to really expand. At first I was expecting a mission driven resource collecting game to expand my village but it slowly turned into much more and when I finally took a step back I came to the realization that I had gone from a builder to a samurai and was slaying bandits and animals while visiting my village time to time as it grew on it's own with a bit of work on my part. This game is really fun in solo I can't even imagine the fun I would have in co-op and I am looking forward to having a hunting party so I can bring forth the wrath upon the lands!",

Building structures have become more varied but scene appropriate.  They expanded the \"legend\" or skill rank ups in a nice way and the fact they're putting in some interesting combat mechanics just adds to it.  When i first purchased this months ago, it was a great purchase on deal,  at this point in development I'd pay more than full price to see the next developments as far as territory and conquest developments, and the option for both genders and some customization in pipeline.  Also organization system in villages requiring actual balancing is pretty realistic in early game then gets easier with way of leader developments rank ups, so you can focus on the next thing.  The areas i can see for improvement not currently mentioned in development timeline is more advanced quest lines (or maybe i haven't got far enough beyond increase dynasty level for next village) and maybe voice acting at some point though i get cost vs reward is questionable.  As it stands this is my new favorite game of the year went from an 8/10 to 11/10 with last updates.",

Here you go, game where you gather rice, make sake and hunt.\nIt feels like Medieval Dynasty on steroids. There is more everything - mechanics, buldings, improved village management (both in terms of resources and villagers assignments). Now some of those gathering/production building have beds inside. Many crafting schemes are obtain either via purchase or you just need to get your hands on one of such items to unlock crafting of it. You can wait with your dynasty level to unlock certain building or you can find build plans and build it sooner. I really like that option.\nRecent fighting system is awesome. Really looking forward how the game will improve even more (definitely more apparel, specially gloves).",

Music is on point, the art and setting are really immersive, characters are relatable, setting is deep. As it stands though there isn't much more content after 22 hours. I am expectantly waiting for the devs to add more content and fix a lot of the critical issues with the early access. If the devs are reading, here's a list of issues so far:\n\n1) many tools building into general storage is broken: example bucket, chiseled stone. it just doesn't create anything. \n2) paper is broken. paper bark can't be obtained from paper trees and my peasants keep using the bark i forage for other purposes\n3) no point to build another base. i built a lake base for ice and it was a pain in the butt with little upside. expanding my main base would've been more efficient. need to have resources distributed around more to incentivize expansion building\n4) ice is bugged: it melts in spring, the motherlode keeps resetting on save. there's no clear description to where the motherlodes are. it sells for way too much money\n5) water was bugged. when i started playing, my worker at the well can only generate a tiny bit of water. i wasn't creating enough to feed my village. now, not sure if it was a bugfix, but my villagers are generating a ton of water just from the well, which defeats the need for tea and sake (pain in the butt to make)\n6) no clear explanation on how to get more villagers. i had to scrounge the web to figure out how to expand my city\n7) job management is a pain. i need to keep monitoring for things out of season manually. the list of jobs is not sorted or filterable so for big bases, it's a ton of scrolling. job icons don't have tool tips so i had no idea i was missing something until i spent time digging through my jobs. i can't reserve specific materials for certain needs. like: \"don't use my planks for maintenance, use clay\" or vice versa",

You start off with nothin' but a few bob, and before you know it, you're the big cheese, callin' the shots like a proper Don Corleone of the East.\r\n\r\nThe graphics? Cor, they're bang tidy, they are! The landscapes are as pretty as a picture, and the characters ain't half bad lookin' neither. The way they’ve captured the spirit of the era, it’s like they’ve given us a right old chinwag with history itself.\r\n\r\nAnd the combat? Well, it’s more fun than a barrel of monkeys, mate. You’ve got yer sword, and you’re judy choppin’ and changin’ between buildin’ yer dynasty and givin' a few cheeky upstarts the what-for. If you fancy yourself as a bit of a Jack the Lad, this game will have you grinnin’ like thee Cheshire cat.\r\n\r\nThis game is solid as the Tower of London. Sengoku Dynasty is the dog's bollocks, no two ways about it. Get it down ya neck and have a proper go – you won’t be disappointed!",

Similar to Medieval Dynasty, loving the building village and inviting homeless villagers to join\n\nThere's a need for some improvements and features to be added in the future updates (hopefully). \n\nNeeds to improve:\n- The LACK of gameplay tutorials and guidance on how things work. I find myself on google most of the time because I don't remember certain things being shown on tutorials/guide.\n- Player interface. It's okay but it needs better categorisations. SPECIALLY the Dynasty tab!\n\nFeatures to add (?): \n- Village buildings icon on the map. \n- A list of resources and what they are for. I struggle to differentiate whats a dang HERB and what's just a flower....\n- Auto categorise/separate resources! I HATE how I have to find individual storage buildings to categorise them! Can I just put it in the General Storage and the game moves them automatically to their respective *proper* storage?!\n- ....are we ever gonna get to make our own family? (yk to continue the *dynasty*)\n\nSO FAR! It's been a great game. I just dislike micromanaging.......\n\nVERSION 1.0:\n\nFirst off, new contents are amazing. I have 100 hours on the game now. \nSecondly, the lag and the optimisation is disappointing. Yes, I looked at the recommended system requirements and yes - my PC meets all of it. NO CRASHES so far! But the lag is horrible. \n\nI will ofc continue playing as I have been since Early Access. Bugs from previous versions still exists and persists so hoping the dev team will finally fix those.",

It is very similar to Medieval Dynasty with a few differences that give it its own unique feel. I like the environment and the gameplay for sure. That being said, its still very barebones. Map is tiny with only a few major points of interest. Not a whole lot to do or see. Very few quests. Main storyline is basically non existent. Then we come to my BIGGEST complaint. The villager cap. Having a villager cap makes it so that you cannot progress past Dynasty level 21 AND makes it so that once you have hit that point, you can no longer expand. You will likely run out of villagers after your first 2 or 3 villages. And once you have done the very minimal amount of things to do in the game, there is literally nothing else to do besides build. Considering its the main aspect of the game, it seems outright stupid to make that part of the game have an upper limit. You will never get more than roughly 100 people.",

Lots of things still needs to be fully flush out...quests, recipes, plants, animals, cosmetic items, building parts, crafting parts, how things unlock, maps, and tweaks and addition to the combat system.  However, the current content is entertaining enough to keep me occupied for at least 40 hours and I enjoyed the game for what it is and is looking forward to what it will become in the future.  \r\nI do have one major gripe and that is with the build menu.  It does need more streamline organization.  There are so many menu selection on 'storage' that it is just confusing for a new player like me and they are all place in different menu trees.  Same thing can be said of 'lights'.   Perhaps streamline all storage item under one menu tree?  Same with lights?  Also, perhaps more in depth description for what the different items do....same can be said of hanging lantern.  I have no clue how to create a hanging lantern.  It was not intuitive.   So my major complaint with the state of the game is with how awkward the build menu is.",

At its current stage, it's still highly addicting and offers different gameplay styles as you wish with so much to do - combat, farming, building, strategy, and so much more. Bonus option of multiplayer. Even at its early stage, this game feels almost complete, but that may be also be because there's just a lot going on. Almost too much to the point of the game not being very intuitive especially those not familiar with similar games of those style. Without divulging into specifics, this game has great potential to be absolutely amazing with more tweaks/less redundancy to certain mechanics, so good thing it's only early access.",

I put it on the backburner for like a year because it had crazy load times at release. I just played through a few times, including the new update. It feels like a decent base game but not quite finished. it needs another year of updates and added content before I would call it a good game. \nWhat puzzles me about it is that they already had it right with Medieval Dynasty. The UI was better, the citizen management was better, the hunting was better, etc. Its like they already had all the right pieces of the puzzle to make Sengoku feel more complete at launch, yet decided to go back and reinvent everything from the ground up. The update helped a lot and I feel like they are going in the right direction with it, but it needs a lot more updates when all they really needed was to add more content past the village building that was offered in Medeival. The story and immersiveness feels a bit better in Sengoku, and the special projects are the thing that stood out the most. If they continue to expand on that idea it will be good. Its just a bit frustrating that the game feels more like a first draft than a finished product considering how long its been since release. They already had the bones",

            "review": "This game is great and I was very captivated at launch.  Put the game down for a while and decided to give it another go a couple days ago to check out the new updates.  Still think it's a fun game, but is ruined by janky gamepad controls.  If you use keyboard and mouse, you probably won't run into as many issues, but many of the gamepad controls are completely broken.  The layout is fine, but many of them don't work as intended.  It's as though the different controls that are implemented for different interactions are fighting with each other.  For example, Y button crouches, Y button also interacts with merchants, but still activates crouch.  Right trigger should rotate structures while placing them, but instead cancels structure placement.  Also a problem I encountered for both gamepad and mouse is that when you hold the button to draw an arrow from bow, you release the button and sometimes the arrow doesn't shoot and the arrow remains drawn as though you were still holding the button down.  Spamming the shoot button doesn't shoot the arrow either when this happens.  Animal you were hunting escapes or attacking bandit kills you.  Very infuriating.  I love using gyro aiming and when I can, I use gyro as mouse because mouse is more responsive.  Few games allow gamepad and mouse functionality and this game is one of them, which is awesome, but when I activate gyro to mouse, a mouse cursor shows up on the screen while aiming.  Doesn't happen when using only mouse and keyboard though, so I couldn't begin to guess why it would in this specific scenario, but it's very distracting.  There were many other problems with the controls that I encountered but didn't really write them down and can't remember them all.  I hope they fix these issues, because it really is a gem of a gaming experience.  Even with these frustrations, I put up with them for over 70 hrs of play.  Done now though.",

I fully accepted that it's early access and didn't expect much, I just appreciated what was present and hoped for more. As time has passed, the devs have been excellent about consistent updates and listening to player feedback, and there's been steady progress since launch. \nLook, I didn't buy a new house still under construction and complain about the lack of decorations, that the kitchen is completely unusable, and there's total lack of plumbing. I expected a walk through of the floor plan, to get a say in how it's finished being built, and enjoy watching a home come to life over time. What I'm saying is, anyone who buys into an early access game and gets upset that their expectations of a fully fleshed out game were not met doesn't mean that the game is a problem, it means there was an issue with appropriately managing expectations.  People have honestly gotten spoiled with what 'early access' mean. By definition, it's going to be incomplete, unbalanced, lack features, have bugs, and won't be polished. Like I said, I absolutely love this game, both where it's been, where it's currently at, and where it's headed. I 100% believe in the devs goals so if you want that Medieval Dynasty game but in feudal Japan, it'll get there - just give it time.",

The stories of the people and the environment are beautiful. The seasons lasting a few days still seems a bit weird but it has customisation.

            "review": "Shows promise – but clearly still has a long way to go. \r\nThe landscape, day – night cycle, weather and changing seasons are visually impressive and immersive. \r\nSadly, the same cannot be told for the people. There is no player customization, not even gender wise. The look changes somewhat depending on the clothes being worn, but these can’t be customized or dyed and there is a clear progression, that makes lower tier clothing obsolete. NPC villagers all look the same, although there are males and females. While you can produce clothing, you can’t make your villagers wear it. Or if you can, I didn’t find out how. \r\nFinding out how to do things is what I spent a lot of time doing. There was very little guidance inside the game. As can be expected, the game is also pretty grindy. I don’t mind resource gathering, but after having cut down enough trees to build the Spanish Armada, chasing logs tumbling downhill becomes repetitive. I feel on normal difficulty it would be reasonable to expect villagers to be able to provide for themselves, but there is always something missing, forcing you to stop doing whatever it is you were doing and running back to the village to stuff their mouths or wipe their …\r\nProgression felt weird. There are a lot of different resources. Sadly, not all can be found around your starting village. Eventually, as you discover more of the area, you will come across other resources, but some of them are in constant demand, so you need to do resource runs. And there is always something missing. Not only quantity wise (your axe will soon be your best friend), but also quality wise. And then it is a matter of the hen and the egg. At one point, I was asked to produce steel tools. Naturally, the NPCs would not allow me to use their forge, so I had to go home and build one. But to build one, you need to be a certain “dynasty” level, which is mostly done by recruiting (otherwise mostly useless) villagers. And then you need other resources, and tools, which require new resources and buildings to make… the list is endless. Which would not be problematic, if there was some sort of natural progression. \r\nCombat felt like a transplant, something pushed into the game to make it less dull. After having bum-rushed by wolves for the third time, the charm wore off quickly though. For some reason, boars, wolves and especially bears are much harder than the NPC bandits. And unlike bandits, they don’t have a visible health bar, for some reason. I can understand the immersion factor in not knowing their health, but on the other hand, humans have a health bar, and so do your tools.\r\nThere is some sort of quest system in place, but it is very basic and honestly not much fun. It also decidedly needs more information on how to accomplish certain goals. \r\nTalking about basic: there is no voice over at all after the intro. Granted the conversations with the NPCs aren’t especially exciting anyway. \r\nFor how basic the game is, it is surprisingly hardware-demanding. I had to tune down some of the recommended settings because my computer started to make worrying levels of noise. There really is no reason why such a quaint game should be more resource demanding than say Cyberpunk 2077. Clearly, optimization is possible (and badly needed).\r\n\r\nVerdict: Would not buy again.\r\nRecommendation: Wait a year and then buy for 20 $ or less.",

A bunch of \"rough\" looking folks around their 30s and 40s.\n\nI recommend giving the game a go if you simply want to test out or support the game's development. Otherwise get ready for a skeleton of a game.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n-More variety of npcs, faces, hair, etc.\n+All I see is Bob1 Bob2 and Bob3. Oh look there's Sarah12 and Sarah 22\n\n-Character customization\n+I am supposed to be a leader, unique from everyone else, not just another Bob\n+Why NOT?\n\n-Roaming bandits, npcs, encounters/ambushes\n+Animals roam, but I've only come across bandits that sit at their camp all day.\n+Encounters would definitely make the game more interesting, while you're exploring.\n\n-Random biome spawns\n+Animals seem to all spawn together at a spot and disperse\n+Adding chances of spawning at certain biomes during certain seasons would be more realistic, rather than just making them always spawn at certain spots. I recommend following ARK's way of spawning creatures.\n\n-Hunting is WAY too easy\n+Make it harder, but more rewarding.\n+Increase their detection using elements such as visibility/darkness, sound, and smell which can be more detectable when you're on the highground. Not asking for \"The Hunter\" just something closer to that.\n\n-Management feels too tedious\n+I'm their leader, not their mother. You know how to stay warm. Why do I have to tell you to chop some wood then turn it into firewood. Let me assign them a job and they'll get what they can for the season. If I want a priority on something I'll simply let them know.\n\n-And WORST of all, the game feels like a fetch quest simulator.\n+I've got nothing, just feels like it.\n\n-Additionally, I personally think mod support should always be included. This has been said SO MANY TIMES and YET, mod support will keep a game interesting, especially when it is still being updated. So what if it breaks all mods. They know the risks. If you really want to help modders out with that part then release a beta to opt in. People have been asking for it a long time on Medieval Dynasty, but nothing still. I fear this game will also not have it in the future.\n\nThat's what I have for now. Despite all that, I still like the game and look forward to what they have coming in the future.",

Luckily, the thinking sort I am, knew this was an early access release and had both the bones and devs behind it to make something great... in time! The team was prompt to release into early access with a detailed road map and the game reflected the work that was to be done as you could tell what was missing. Returning a year later on a whim and coincidentally on the eve of a major update, I was not disappointed at the games progress since and plays like a labor of love which lots more to come.",

            "review": "Honestly - I think it's a good game, BUT - to the *right* player. I am not the right player. I give my suggestion below followed by why I stopped playing.\n\n**All of this could be fixed if there were simple mouse-over tooltips for each icon telling you basic info like \"Hey, your villager is hungry. To fix this, build a place which supplies food and water.\"**\n\nThere is very little guidance - which is okay, if that was what was advertised. The new player experience is rough if you aren't willing to have a google tab open, and I expected better guidance because the trailers and dev updates frequently mention how casual friendly the game can be if you choose it to be. \n\nBut in my first 1.5 hours I've found myself having to go down a google rabbit hole to figure out the most basic functions and icons, recipes, etc. \n\nFor example, in the first 15 minutes ur told to build up your village, feed a new recruit, give her a job. But no where in the game does it tell you you need to build 3-4 different \"storage\" structures just to be able to assign a job or feed her. The game does tell you \"Villager requires storage access to accept this job.\" So I built a simple container for storage, assuming I could drop food and water in there for her. \n\nWoops, wrong storage. You need 3 different storage *buildings*, not just a storage container. Game doesn't tell you this in any way shape or form. Meanwhile your villager is sad and hungry and waiting for you to get your ish together. And when you find out which buildings are required to get this ball rolling, the rabbit hole gets deeper as you learn you need resources you haven't seen up to this point. So now ur googling where to find these resources. There is no pause unless you exit to main menu, so when you finish researching you come back and now u have multiple glaring red icons that you have to *assume* mean nobody is happy and everything is terrible and you dont have anything you need to fix it. \n\n\n\nI thought I'd be able to just put food in my house and have my first villager access it so she doesnt starve and run away, at least giving me time to situate the village. Makes sense, right? No. She needs various seperate entire buildings - food storage, a water well, anything else? And you need to give her the tools, the food, the water, to get her started. And like I said - that's *fine* - but at least tell me she needs that stuff. I imagine trying to micromanage all of this at a later stage in the game with multiple villagers and it's daunting. Steam forums are the only reason I learned any of this and made it further than an hour.  \n\nSeems cool, new combat update looks awesome, I just don't have enough \"git gud\" to figure out the early game and it's more tedious than challenging.",

Graphics are meeh, targeting and picking up items is weird (cursor in middle of screen and just awkward to use), and there's silly bugs. For example, if you build your first village bell and something kills you (like a wolf) you will continuously respawn while the wolf is still there and it will kill you again and again and again. This forces a game restart since the wolf never leaves and you die forever. Maybe try it out if you get it on discount? but as of right now i'd be pretty upset if I paid full price for this silliness.",

What I underestimated about the game was it's art direction that captures the best parts of japans love for nature and the symbiotic relationship they have.\r\nWhile the combat in the early access game is in need of polishing and intensity, the current system is still a lot of fun for what it is. When the 1.0 combat system comes out I'm sure from the game play videos it will fill the only gap I was personally looking for. If anyone is wondering if the game can be enjoyed while in early access, the answer is yes as there is almost no end of thing to do in Sengoku Dynasty.",

At first, I played it on someone else's server, it was alright, but it kept lagging and crashing on me. I play on the steam deck. When I tried to play solo, I had many of the same issues but it was worse. I could barely play the game before my game would crash and it was so laggy, I couldn't do anything without it taking at least five minutes. When I attempt to go to the watchtower as part of my quest, it completely shuts down on my steam deck, I can't even get close to the watchtower and I am lagging so hard, and then the screen goes dark. I understand the game is new, and it has bugs and stuff that need to be fixed, but a game shouldn't be unplayable as soon as you start. I am extremely disappointed that I cannot play it at all. Hopefully, this will get fixed soon.",

I happen to love historical Asian cultures, particularly the way the way societies formed and stayed stable throughout the years. This game is really one that touches on those aspects while maintaining the gaming experience. One of the only things that I can think of is adding in other animals, like livestock (particularly horses and oxen, and expanding on the Bandits. Maybe even adding rival villages, bigger Bandit camps, and maybe an actual city. Adding in some other jobs would also be nice. You put so much thought into the current jobs, but there are so many more that exist, such as pharmacists and samurai. \n\nPlease keep in mind that I have no degree in any of this and it is purely based off of my own research. This is just a hobby and I am NOT an expert.\n\nUPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI am SO EXITED!!! I have been waiting for the official release of the 1.0 and it is finally here! I can't wait to start playing for real, and so far have only gotten to the creation of my first house, but looking at the changes that I can already see, it was so worth the wait. I think that I will only update this with my thoughts on the game after I have gotten through most of it, but I can already tell that I will be having so much fun with this, especially with the family portion.",

            "review": "I love survival crafting games like this, and I don't mind playing them in early access.  I only hope the developers will take my feedback and make the game even better.\n\nFirst off, lets just get the #1 issue out of the way.  There is currently no combat system for this game.  For a game where I strive to become a Samurai or a Lord, there should be a robust combat system where I can challenge people to fight, and then actually fight things.  I'm chalking this one up to what we have now being placeholder, but Superkami, you have got to invest time and money into a good combat system or it will kill your game.\n\nSecondly, tools break far too easily.  I can only chop down and cut into logs about 4-5 trees before a stone axe is broken beyond repair.  Either my durability is draining too fast, or they need more.  Please look into this for a future balancing patch.\n\nI cannot believe in this year of our lord 2024, we are still holding a button to gather.  Please add an accessibility option to gather by clicking.  It's tedious and can actually cause pain in your players' hands.  Also, when you gather, you should gather all of that resource in a small area around you.\n\nNot being able to move the city Bell needs to be changed.  I set up my city initially and then as I started laying things out I wanted to change its location.  Let me do so.\n\nThe UI where you assign your townspeople to jobs or housing is a bit buggy in that you have to click in specific spots or nothing happens.  Consider some adjustments to clickable areas on this screen to make it a bit more friendly.\n\nAll that said, the game is beautiful and so far pretty fun.  It has good bones, but just needs more time to bake before it's really ready.\n\nIf you are a fan of the survival crafting and village building genre, I'd suggest holding off on this one for now.   Pop it in your wishlist and watch those updates.  Wait for a combat system to be added.",

            "review": "Most of the feedback is based on creative mode:\nI got the game awhile ago and found out my computer wouldn't run it well with the 3GB graphics card I had for the past 10 years, but I finally got an upgrade to the 4060 8GB which lets me run the game with fairly good graphics (might even run ultra, but I haven't felt like testing it that high yet).\n~~~~~~~~~~\nAnyway! The game so far. I run creative mode because I like the building aspect of it the most. You build most things without having to go and collect the resources and all that jazz. Crafting costs nothing and you don't drain stamina or health, but items still wear/rot/break. All or most blueprints are unlocked from the start for all the building fun.\n\nPro's:\n- Looks good, environmentally and the buildings are realistic imo\n- Can change between 1st and 3rd person view\n- Villager needs are pretty straightforward once you get past the initial learning phase (and can be broken down in the priorities tab)\n- The music is nice\n- Fast travel is great for getting between villages\n- I like the story although I haven't completed it yet and I am sure there will be more to it as the game continues development.\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCon's:\n- Some items seem repetitive (water bucket and fertilizer bucket are different from just a bucket is one example)\n- This is primarily to do with me being in creative mode and less to do with the game, but I feel like it is easy to be overwhelmed with resource needs when you start getting villagers because they only do the one job. So, in order to make sure you have a positive income of any need you have to do most of the work and you won't be able to satisfy every need until much later depending on your speed of understanding what leads to what. \n- You can't plant more trees!! Even if it is decorative I think players should be able to include more greenery in the village. They do pop up randomly on their own, but I think it would be nice to see an option to plant a sapling somewhere and watch it slowly grow in your village if possible. \n~~~~~~~~~~~\nAdditional comments: This is for the random bugs I have seen and some things I am looking forward to or would like to see added. (Again this is mostly geared towards creative mode gameplay)\nBugs:\n- Some of the story related villagers you recruit never lose the beggar icon over their heads even after you accept them into your village.\n- I ended a season once and woke up in a bamboo slave cage, but glitched into the ceiling of it so I couldn't tear it down with my axe or jump or duck out of it. I had to respawn from the pause menu and now my health is permanently stuck at a quarter health even if I use healing balms.\n- When you go to sleep you don't wake up on the bed you slept on you wake up on the floor.\n- Animals can run into your village but your guards don't react and if it is a wolf it will find you and nom you.\n\nComments:\n- I am looking forward to when the inventory/dynasty/legend tabs are updated. I have seen some people who have it and it looks wayyyyyy more interactive and detailed than the one that is in use now. (Being able to see someone's age, resource management... etc..)\n- I can't wait for more village aesthetic releases. Waht we have access to now is nice, but compared to the detailed and beautiful buildings you see at the temple and the other major villages it seems we don't have the option to build fortress style villages or buildings yet.\n- I would really like to see village designations as well if it is not being worked on already. For example I know we can name our village and choose a symbol, but it would be cool if there was a village type we could choose when we first build the alarm bell that would provide unique structure options depending on the type. (Spiritual, Military, Economic)\n- Even though you can make clothing and shoes and hats and tools for villagers that seem to reflect specific roles, there is no way that I have found to equip it to them. My three villages have people in peasant clothing with no shoes or hats even in the winter. My priestess looks like a beggar.\n- When rebuilding Sosogi in creative mode it seems like some of the previous villagers haven't gotten around to having the option to join your village. This could be jsut becuase of where I am in the story, but I figured it was worth mentioning because the herb lady has a little tent that is surrounded by better buildings lol\n- I hope we get to do village animals at some point. Even if they spawn randomly once your village reaches a certain population or if it is a 1 per village purchase of some kind I think it would add to the life of the village more.\n~~~~~~~~\nLastly, this game is still being developed and there are other things I could mention about what I would want to see or am looking forward to seeing, but so far it has been super fun just chilling on creative mode. I am looking forward to the rest of their updates and to see the game become even more fun to play over time! I really liked Medieval Dynasty, but the aesthetics of this game is better imo.",

There is a wide range of things to build and improvements to make on what you have built previously. Factors to manage increase incrementally and each plays into the overall happiness level of your settlers. Interactions with random bandits are very basic. in that AI and tactics around combat are not a focus of this game. It is primarily a resource management builder game with some questing. \r\n\r\nHonestly, as I find myself coming to the end of the quest lines, I find that building for the sake of building and just managing the population's happiness will not be enough to keep me playing. There needs to be a wealth of quests to keep the game interesting, such as responding to weather events, preparing for a barbarian attack, making treaties, etc.",

Yes, kinda, but it needs more work. I took my time and in 28,5 hours of game play I am at Dynasty level 13 and ready to build a second and third village, but not really knowing what the end goal is. I do not recommend buying this game at full price, I feel like it can only reach that point when the games fixes their bugs and really expand the current state of the game. I think this game could have major potential and I'm willing to give them their time to create something beautiful. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Beautiful visuals; the game itself looks pretty e.g. skies/sunsets\r\n- I like the skill system, though it needs a lot more options as it is quite scarce right now.\r\n- Quests are easy to follow\r\n- I have only played it on easy mode, I feel they do their level difficulty justice. \r\n- The village can look really nice, the design of the buildings is okay looking, I feel like there is improvement on this aspect. In some buildings there is excessive space, you don't really know what to do with this. I would strongly recommend to devs implementing an option where you can design your building yourself. Walls right now often don't align with each other. \r\n- The game is very relaxing, you can explore the map, it is pretty and quite big. It also has some hidden aspects, which is pleasant. \r\n- If you like a game where you have to grind, this is a game for you. \r\n\r\nCons: \r\n- NPC's don't look visually appealing\r\n- Villagers don't always perform their tasks\r\n- Map glitches quite often, randomly exclamation marks moving around when you zoom in/out. \r\n- Villages are very static, no liveliness and very robot like. The system also is kinda weird, I have around 30 villagers but need more than a 1000 food. Villagers have no interactions between them, no relationships/marriages or kids. \r\n- Combat system is not good as it is right now, you can't dodge any incoming attacks and you also don't see the damage you're inflicting on the enemy. \r\n- You can't swim, I could walk on water. \r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- Would love to see animals, e.g. horses as mounts, chickens, pigs, really experiencing village life.\r\n- A logical farming system and corresponding needs to villagers\r\n- In depth story and (main) character development \r\n- More customizing in game\r\n- Villagers-needs display, more autonomy, like sims",

I realize this is early release, but until they fix the issues with NPCs, This isn't going to get a recommend from me. Tasking villagers to jobs, seem to end when in the wrong season, or they run out of whatever they are using to produce their product. This means you have to continuously go back and restart them over and over again.

IDK if there's more levels but i maxed the hunter tree and the barter tree in under 1 hour. didn't get into the village building because of the same dialog bug the first game had.\n\nany time i talk to ako i get stuck in the convo with no way out but to force close the game and restart.. why is this still a thing like it was fixed in the first game. did they just copy and past the code from MD and give it a japan reskin??\n\nthe combat is terrible why am i able to out run a deer and kill it from 5ft away with a stone knife??? and why can i attack bandits with a spear and they just stand there like they are dumbstruck. then when they attack they have a 10ft reach with a 3ft stick... \n\nall i know is im glad i tested it first so i can get my money back.... maybe when they spend another 3 years in EA then it might be worth 10bucks. untill then stay away. \n\n",

The main goal is to establish your Dynasty by building a village that will eventually grow into a large self sustaining community, and establish your heir so that your bloodline survives through history.\r\nGet it in the bundle with Medieval Dynasty and get more value and enjoyment for your money.\r\nI'm definitely looking forward to see how this game will develop.",

Definitely makes you want to play more and has a nice \"Far East\" setting.

            "review": "Do I recommend this game?\n\nThe short answer is \"Yesn't\".\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPros:\n\nI personally enjoy the game-play loop of gathering resources > building > recruiting villagers > gather resources > and so on.  This is a great game to shut your brain off and build a scenic Japanese village over time.  But at the same time, i recognize that this is not a lot of player's cup of tea.\n\nThe game runs pretty well on my 3070ti and only suffers performance hits when entering some of the larger villages (around 5-10 fps drop).\n\nWhile content is still pretty lean, the game seems to be updated fairly regularly and many of my complaints in the next section may soon be addressed.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nMoving to the cons of this game:\n\nCombat is both too simple and too difficult, it's hard to tell where an enemy's attacks will land, there's no blocking or parry feature as far as I can tell which forces you to either try to manually sprint away before being hit or you have to just tank the damage. It's hard to predict animal's hit boxes and all the raider's I've fought use spears which are pretty much impossible to fight with a katana. There is also a lack of audio queues or other feedback that could help make combat more enjoyable.  But as i understand it, this is likely to be addressed in a future update.\n\nLack of customization and NPC depth is a big complaint for me.  Having played games like Rimworld where you can control almost every aspect of your colonists, including the clothes and weapons they use to compliment their specific jobs and skill sets, I find this game severely lacks in those departments.  I'd love to see my villagers have specific traits that make them better at one job over another, or more adept at certain combat styles.  I'd also like to be able to give my villagers specialized clothes to align with their jobs (IE Give my guards armor).  I feel these villagers can be better fleshed out in so many ways, including relationships, family bonds, etc.  After awhile, they just kinda feel like mute slaves instead of your friends and neighbors.\n\nLastly, I find the building in this game a bit disappointing.  I expected it to be more akin to Valheim or ARK where I can create whatever structures I want with snapable parts (i'll admit that's on me tho). Aside from fences, farming plots, and some other structures this isn't the case.  All core buildings are prefabs with certain furniture and entrance requirements.  While you can further change the layout of entrances, building materials, and some furniture it leads me to feeling a bit restricted in making my village feel like a unique town.  But I also understand that this may be intentional as it both forces the villages to look more authentic and is directly tied to how resource production works in this game, so I doubt that part will change.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nTLDR:\n\nIf you like chill resource gathering games like Valheim, some mild colony management, or are super interested in this period of Japanese history it's a game I think you should wishlist or purchase when it goes on sale.\n\nAs it stands currently, there's bones for a great game here but much of it needs to be fleshed out.  Until that happens, or they add workshop/mod support to bridge the content gap, I have a hard time recommending this game to anyone but the most hardcore base builder/colony sim enthusiast.\n\n\n",

The Water Meter is gone, so we're back to being the Übermensch for our village who can work 4-5 times as hard as any villager, 4 days straight requiring zero sleep with no debuffs. So instead of carefully managing production chains, you end up pocket- or station crafting to make huge stockpiles once in a while.\r\nNothing is dangerous - in Medieval, you wouldn't duel a bear without planning, a good crossbow and maybe a friend. In Medieval, hope you have enough Stamina to outrun the wolves. Or even better, a mount.\r\nHere? 1:1 a sixpack of wolves with the basic spear, no problem. Most of the time you don't even react to damage, have fun randomly dying. A boar did this to me randomly while chopping wood, didn't hear it over the loud music, I died, the boar spawnkilled me for the next 10 minutes because the game bugged into the complete UI not reacting. Fun times, had to kill the program and reload.\r\n\r\n[h2]The WHY?!s[/h2]\r\nThere is SOME few and rare upgrades to systems, i.e. the ore/stone deposit stuff.\r\nWHY is there recipes requiring just iron ore now, that... just doesn't make sense.\r\nWHY does a lake have 4 ice \"deposits\" - the whole lake is frozen over and I have to look for 4 magic spots, 3 of them just not where they're shown on the map, which don't trigger my pickaxe to actually do stuff.\r\nWHY do we now have to assign villagers with tools for stuff when the definition for the job says \"any type is fine\" and I provide them with tools.\r\nWHY is it not easy to track which villagers actually work and if not, why? I provided everything for my Charcoal-Maker to make charcoal, yet he sweeps the floor with 340 units of Firewood in storage.\r\n\r\nWHY is there, in 2024, Quests with greyed out text?! THIS WORKED IN MEDIEVAL JUST GO COPY THE CODE?!\r\nI double and triplechecked, the quest for turning in 5 iron axes and 5 steel pickaxes, which I had in my inventory, just doesn't let me turn them in.\r\nThe quest to get rid of mask woman told me to first go to Kengyou to find out what to do. I found mask woman first, tried talking, couldn't figure it out, now the \"!\" for Kengyou was gone. Yeah I'm not looking for that guy, there's wood to be chopped.\r\n\r\nWHY is all crafting time 1s? The point of making it tedious is so perks are an incentive and outsourcing stuff to your villagers feels worth it. Now I'll just craft 300 soups.\r\n\r\nWHY have tons of clothes to pick from, only to never shiver in the winter anyways? I was out there in tabi and half-naked taking zero damage.\r\nWHY is debarking vs. firewood a thing oh god I need BOTH for leather/steel and charcoal/steel which leads to AXE - ADZE - AXE and kills all the benefits of the multi-use\r\n\r\nWHY is spirituality so ill-explained? Why not have the tutorial stuff saved in the menu to look up later?\r\nWHY is there 3 perks per tree, I played for 2 hours and already had everything unlocked there is to unlock.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h2]The Ugly[/h2]\r\nPlaying this for more than an hour with firefox open makes the game slower. How?\r\nHow have you figured this out in Medieval?\r\nWhy the fuck does the inventory have a slot system now and 100 grass weigh as much as a singular log, either simplyfy it or make it harder but I can't explore as much as in medieval and that's unfun. Also, have yet to see a backpack upgrade. Is there even?\r\nMounts?! MOUNTS?!\r\n\r\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\r\nI trusted Toplitz with this one because Medieval was a hard learning curve, but all the stuff at least made sense.\r\nThis one doesn't make much sense right now and seriously would be FINE IN EARLY ACCESS\r\nIF IT WASN'T CALLED A \"DYNASTY\" GAME, LOOKS AND PLAYS LIKE ONE BUT ALREADY IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THE PREQUEL?!\r\nThanks for the discount when I have Medieval tho :) \r\n",

However, there still a lot of shortcomings in game in my opinion.\n\nPros:\n- graphics are great\n- background music is fitting to the theme and very relaxing\n- crafting from dynasty inventory (has been introduced with the latest update awesome!)\n- combat (has been improved in the latest update, but still requires work, especially where movement is concerned)\n- skill system (has been revamped in the recent update)\n\nNeeds improvements:\n- crafting and building mechanics are solid foundation, but could use some improvements (too much clicking through radial menus, clearly designed to work well on consoles, I'm a PC gamer, I don't care about consoles at all)\n- villager and NPC AI (their pathing needs a lot of improvement; they constantly get stuck on or even in things, it has gotten a little better with the recent update!)\n- story (I know this EA, but God is the story and dialogue that is in the game cheesy and cliché AF)\n- character movement (Please stop using the same buttons for two things! If I press A or D I just want my character to strafe left or right and not turn around in random directions. This would also improve the combat. This is again another implementation designed to ease play on consoles, quite frankly IDGAF about consoles)\n\nMissing:\n- character customization (I don't know if this a planned thing or not, but this is completely lacking in the game, including the option to play as a female character)\n\nTLDR:\nThe recent update has improved a lot of things, but to call this a complete or great game yet would be to early. The biggest gripe I have at this point is the controls. It's clearly designed to work with a controller and I hate that! I'm a PC gamer and play with mouse and keyboard! Considering that this game is only available on PC, this is really poor design choice, but I would hazard a guess that a console release is planned in the future.\n\nI wish there were other options then just Yes and No to chose from, but the short-comings of the game I can't fully recommend the game yet! If you want to support the developer and love this genre like me, than by all means give it a go!",

            "review": "Has a bit to go before I really can give it the recommend to buy, but giving it a thumbs up based on what I've already seen. I played it on the second hardest difficulty without any prior experience or guides.  I only died once to a pirate who I think got into an infinite attack/stamina bug(100-0d me instantly). No game crashes.  No performance issues.  I enjoyed about 10 hours before I had almost everything unlocked, i'm a couple hours from finishing up the remaining quests and special projects.\n\nAreas that are not really developed or need further refinement:\nvalue system - Minimum value is 1 coin for everything, which means its easier for you to just grab up a bunch of sticks or grass and sell them for 100's of coins then to try to craft goods.\nskill/perk tree - The concept is there, but there's only a couple of perks, within the first hour of play you could unlock them all, except for the monk ones. A few are required for skinning fur and fat.\ncombat - it's very janky at the moment, playable, but needs work.\nanimal spawning is too plentiful at the moment and it gets to be where some areas feel like you're aggroing the entire forest\nThe work system is a bit too flat imo, maybe if your workers had skills or affinities or likes/dislikes, etc. \nMounts or something for better traversal.  The fast travel is okay I guess.\nMercs or something.\nMore interesting enemies besides random pirate camps and large number of auto-aggro animals.\nArmor/Clothes doesn't seem to do anything beyond aesthetics and proving luxury.\nThe loop is a little stale, eventually you can get your village(s) to be self-sustaining, but for a while it's more of you trying to spend many hours just to make sure everyone's needs are met.\n\nbugs:\nI could never place the fishing boat.  I can't place the fishing hut any further out, but the shoreline I guess is too tall for my boat? I tried all manner of rotations and moving, but had no luck.\nenemies spawning in rocks/buildings\nweapon randomly won't attack even though you have it out and have stamina, switching weapons fixed it",

            "review": "Like most EA titles coming out, this one has plenty of issues that need ironed out before it's worth playing/buying.  \n\nGraphics are quite nice and the overall atmosphere of the game is definitely there.... unfortunately though, that ends the good points of the game atm.\n\nBetween an endless list of chores to perform just to maintain a minor village and the needs system making you scratch your head on what is what, you'll end up frustrated and confused.  Even playing on creative mode and building everything needed for the village, the micromanagement of having manually swap crops for each season instead of being able to assign a crop rotation is extremely annoying.  Add in super slow progression and feeling like you're a piece of wet tissue paper in combat to make for an abysmal gaming experience.\n\nCompound that further with the mind numbing and rather asinine decision to make the player rediscover motherload resources daily to keep your workers functioning and you'll regret not refunding the game.\n\nI'd give it a good 6 months or a year to see if things have improved but I wouldn't waste my money at this point.",

I've always been heavy into settlement/base building type games though, so I focus mainly on building and such. Things like adventures and quests are still to be implemented (there are a couple of very simple ones in the game at the moment).  My main like is the setting. So many of these games are set in Generic Medieval Europe(TM) which is overdone. This game, set in medieval Japan, is a fresh setting and approach.  I look forward to seeing this game get as well developed as Medieval Dynasty! (Written June 2024).",

I hope the full release adds more quests, side-quests, and achievements.\n\nIt's a very relaxing game, has a lot of neat features, but it still needs more reason to keep playing. There's only so many times you can expand a village before losing interest.\n\n9/10, will probably jump to a 10/10 once the full release is out,\n\n\n\nEdit 9/14/24 - Still not full release, but the updates have drawn me back in to creating a new world. Interface for jobs and perks have improved game quality, making it easier to play and more relaxing. New combat has made fighting bandits much more fun. Currently sitting at a 9.4/10 - New stories and dynamic questing would bring this game up to a full 10/10 for me\n\nEdit 11/28/24 - New systems are fun. Gameplay feels even more involved, more quests, more challenges, more fun. \n\nGame still needs work, but at its core it's a fun, laid back game",

            "review": "While I really wanted to like this game despite several technical flaws, weird animations, and simply underwhelming (to the point of a nonexistent) combat system, I couldn't recommend it even one year after several major updates after the release. \n\nTechnically, the game is still in EA, so something might change upon release, but in its current state, I cannot recommend it. \n\nThe game offers little to no progression, the gameplay loop becomes a list of chores that take a lot of time, and the crafting/village management system is abysmal. \n\nFor example, there are two variations of a log: a premium and a regular one. Premium ones produce premium planks and regular ones. Pretty simple, right? \n\nIf you started building with regular ones and ran out of them, you can run to your Dynasty Wood Storage, pick some premium logs, take them to the carpentry stations, and craft premium planks. The thing is that you can only use them if you use a special tool - adze - to debark a log and then pick up that log. Not even the plank itself - a log!\n\nAnd the thing is that only the iron adze can be used to debark the premium logs. And those cannot be crafted (at least at my station), so I need to teleport to another village, look for a trader with an iron adze, get back to my village, do the thing with the log just because the game doesn't allow me to use the materials that I already have because I crafted them at the carpentry station and \"didn't debark the stupid log.\" \n\nSome might say that's nothing. But the problem is that the whole game is like that. For every good mechanic, there's some convoluted bullshit that doesn't add anything to the game, and it's there. \n\nMy biggest laugh was when I finally decided to plant some rice and do some farming in general. \n\nFor rice, you need a field with water, which you can create as easily as regular water. The other plants need watering, right? So, for this, you need to build a well and get a bucket. My idea was that I would just build a well and then craft a bucket, get some water from the well, water my plants, and refill the bucket. Rinse and repeat until your plants are watered. \n\nLol no.\n\nYou craft multiple buckets, then THROW them into the well, then WAIT, and then come back and pick up the water. Without the buckets, they are gone. You then craft another bucket at the woodworking table and combine the water from your inventory with this newly created bucket to craft a water bucket. \n\nThat's just some hilarious game design. \n\nWhile you can hire villagers to perform most of the tasks for you, in the beginning, you won't have that luxury and will spend a lot of time running around back and forth to your storage and repeating the same tedious stuff again and again. The sense of progression in this game is really slow. \n\nEven 8 hours into the game, I was still running around picking up some grass because I needed a lot of it, and the game doesn't provide you with an abundance of it like other similar games do. Technically, you can make all of your foragers run around and gather some grass for you, but then they won't be collecting other, more important things like shrooms or WASABI. \n\nThe Needs of the villagers and production tab doesn't make any sense. What do tabs \"Items storage\" and \"Needs in storage\" mean? Do my villagers require 575 firewood every day? Or one firewood is \"5\" Needs for heating, which you can only see after you click on the item. While I kinda figured out how it's calculated, I still don't know how to produce enough food for all my villagers, and I have 2 giant farm plots, 3 fishermen, 2 foragers, and one hunter. More than half of the population is working to provide food, and still more is needed. \n\nAnd while you could assign more people where needed, except for farming, all other jobs require new buildings and stations, which is, again, resources and time to build them. \n\nSo, in the end, you are just running around, trying to hunt some boars (don't make me even get to the shooting mechanics in this game) to feed your population just so they can eat everything you bought to them in one sitting so tomorrow you can repeat the process again. \n\nWhatever out of 10.",

It was rather clunky, the UI was extremely outdated looking, and it just wasn't a lot of fun to play. I also played it right after spending countless hours in Medieval Dynasty. Maybe I was comparing the two games a little too closely.\n\nNow, coming back to it, I'm more impressed. I think they fixed a little bit of the clunkiness, and it feels a lot more playable now. The dialogue is a touch exhaustive and I don't love how it displays, but maybe giving it some time between MD and SD is good. I think the game's story could benefit a lot from a better narrative voice.\n\nOtherwise, it is fun to build up your village and rescue refugees along the way to join in. I haven't progressed far, but I'm hoping that the villagers can have children like in Medieval Dynasty. I'll keep playing to see where this goes. Unless they stop improving the game, or do something disastrous, I think it's worth playing in the future. Possibly hold off until official release, unless you're alright with the occasional bug, and an early release game that actually feels like an actual still-in-development early release, instead of just a sales ploy.",

            "review": "I love this game but I also hate this game and ill tell you why. Firstly me and my friend play this online co-op we've never played single player. I like that you can invite your friend/s into the dialog of a quest when they are half way around the map makes it easier for them to fast travel to you, like the building side, crafting and the graphics are pretty decent to however there is a lot of bad in this game....\n\nFirstly the fast travel is broken regardless of what we do it always ends up broken. When we didn't have a second village it was fine but the minute we built the second village income the bugs. We can load back to an earlier save, fast travel but then it will be an endless load screen.\n\nIf you or your friend goes to sleep before the other person and you leave it for a minute or 2 and then they try to sleep incomes the endless loading screen.\n\nIf you or a friend encounter the endless loading screen then everything else will be broken to ie the animals aswell as the bandits. They will be easy to kill as they don't attack or run away.\n\nSometimes arrows/spears will not hit your target instead they will stop short in the air and just not move.\n\nIf you place a building sometimes you cannot continue with building as it will say people/animals etc are in the way (It says something else but means the same thing)\n\nThis is the bugs i've come across so far but it would be nice to have a game guide in the game ie if you can't remember how to get workers to farm you can go on the game guide and it will tell you step by step how to do it. Aswell as a well organised layout in the building menu. Takes me ages to find what i'm looking for not the worst i've come across in a game but its up there. Also it would be nice to repair items ie if your axe breaks you use half of what it takes to repair it or if you don't need it anymore you can break it down and get resources from it.\n\nIn its current state it is still worth playing as it is a good game and there is loads to do/explore/build/craft etc. Its still early access but for an early access game its still quite fun and enjoyable.",

            "review": "This is just sad. I liked Medieval Dynasty, even tho it isnt a perfect game by any means either.. but this? I dont even know what to call it. Everything is clunky, buggy, and plain worse than in Medieval Dynasty. It feels like a [b]bad[/b] tech demo for Medieval Dynasty, not the other way around.\n\nGame design wise, it feels like you dont get to do the things you want at all. What do you need early on? Food! Hunters are locked behind dynasty level 7. We didnt even get that far before quitting for other reasons. Animals constantly attack you, so weapons would be great too. Dynasty level 11.. oh and it's not like they stop spawning just because you put your village there, nah. Character progression? Pretty much a placeholder. Forget about skill trees, you are lucky if the 2-3 perks even work.\n\nPerformance gets really bad, but maybe part of it was because i was hosting. Medieval Dynasty didnt run well either, but this is just a joke. I run a 3060 TI on a 7700k, and entering the first village i already dropped to 21 FPS. This game simply is not that demanding. I earn my living with software too. It just is not.\n\nIt feels like an empty husk of a game. When you skin animals there is no feedback whatsoever. No hit sound, no blood.. you stab your dagger next to a corpse into the ground with no visual or audio effect whatsoever, then the corpse disappears. We found trees that had no hitbox. Water only exists as a visual effect. Forget about swimming, you can just run through it as if it didnt exist at all. Truth be told, it will be a smoother ride than on actual ground since there wont be plants in your way. Villagers didnt figure out how to sleep yet. Drinking doesnt exist as a mechanic. I dont think you can get poisoned either. There is no weight restrictions anymore.. you can just walk around with 40 logs or so. Plenty of animations and interactions feel clunky as hell. Clients had tons of problems even swapping weapons in time to fend of animals sometimes. I think they tried to improve the UI, but it just somehow feels even less intuitive where things are. Menus feel too \"artsy\" imho, but maybe that's just me. The building mechanic is very similar, but the items needed for that part dont show up in the middle of the screen anymore. Paths? I guess they forgot to implement them here. \n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] Seriously? Sorry devs, but this feels like a proof of concept tech alpha that nobody should have to pay more than 5 bucks for. Certainly not worth the \"full price\" (measured in comparison with Medieval Dynasty) you are charging. It [b]absolutely is not a full game yet, not even close[/b]. There might be potential with it, but as of right now, we feel scammed. If we still could, we would probably refund the game. In Medieval Dynasty you wanted to progress, here you just want to get it over with.",

I saw that they are adding a female and classes, but i feel it would have that from jump... but no. I HATE EA games just wait to drop the full game or try and make basic shit apart of the drop when dropping it in EA..\r\nbut thats just me and how have you not dropped the female, classes aside, dose it take that long? idk im dont make games, but my god. I played 16 mins. i just cant, also again. it runs like crap and i have a beefy pc so i dont get it.",

Okay building, (needs a locking in for fences, etc.) After over 60+ hours I have found my biggest dislikes and that is NPC happiness and NPC jobs.   >>>(To Many Steps for one item without letting NPC collect more items)<<<  It requires many items to craft one item for health, food, building, etc. yet only allows NPC to collect up to four items or build up to four items. By the time I have enough NPC's to collect and build for community there are too many npc's needed in small community. Also fences and buildings should not all have to be built on a flat surface leaving gaps in security. It would like be nice to be able to start your own mine from scratch into one of the many cliff faces in the game even if it takes a while and all you get initially is stone and soil that could be used in the compost instead of just rot... Oh and hopefully the developers read this...If you have plants that you can harvest (i.e. flax hemp, ect.) it might be a good idea to have a crafting recipe for their use...Just saying...\r\n\r\n While it may seem that all I did in my review was complain, it is a decent game as stated. It, like many others, has the bones to be a great game and if it wasn't at least decent, I would not have played over 60 hours just to leave a review.",

The bigger the village the more this unmitigated disaster grows.\n\nAnd last but not least, the horrendous coop: the host will lag like hell and for the client there will be unresponsive inputs and rubber banding galore. As a client, you press a hot key to switch to a weapon or tool from the bar and an sheathing animation plays but you still have the original tool or weapon equipped. Works just as bad from the wheel.\nAlso as a client, once the village is nice and big, it will barely load - like 4-5 minutes after spawning into the game the buildings are still not loaded in. If you plan to have anything bigger than two tents and ♥♥♥♥-house in the village in coop, prepare yourself for 'fun times'.\n\n\nOverall this game is pretty fun to play w/friend and i just hope they change about the color logs,custom build etc.\nHope they change it SOON and im pretty sure its gonna be AMAZING if they did.\n\n",

It complained about my system not having DirectX 12 support, however, running DirectX Diagnostic Tool (DxDiag), the report shows that my system does have version 12.  This error doesn't exist when I run Medieval Dynasty and continued to play this version still.  It's a shame that I can't get this version to run on my system.  Thoroughly, enjoy MD and was hoping to play Sengoku Dynasty since I enjoy the genre.  It's a real shame that i cannot recommend this game and hoping the game developers can rectify this situation, so that I can reverse the recommendation.",

You start as a shipwrecked refugee and must band together with other refugees to build a new home for yourself.  Actually you get to design and build several villages.  There is a generously sized map to explore and several villages and other habitations to find and interact with.  I've played for about 60 hours, and think I have seen most of the early access content.  At the moment there is one simple plot arc per village, and a number of structures (mostly bridges) to build around the map. \r\n\r\nStarting out was fairly easy, but the complexity of resource management gets significantly harder as you add more people to your village.  This is good as it increases the challenge, but also bad as it is difficult to completely automate your village (or I'm not getting it right).  There are options to control how much of each resource is produced which helps, but I find it necessary to manually reassign my workers for each season, especially winter.  The recently added \"Needs\" tab in the menus certainly helps, but the UI gets a bit flaky  when a lot of jobs have been created in the village, particularly if you use a controller.  \r\n\r\nGoing forward, I would like to see a set of story arcs driving you forward to greater heights, with the gradual ability to fully automate the early resource management features, so that the player can concentrate on the new challenges that the later game will impose.",

I don't see any genuine armor with useful stats - just cosmetic impact. \r\nThe village management system is convoluted and generally user unfriendly. For example, there is a rations toggle for each villager need that can be switched between enough to make them happy and some sort of half rations that just make them miserable (why is that even there?) and it resets to the one that makes them unhappy at each new season and sometimes during the season. No clue why it does that - totally infuriating. \r\n\r\nThe screen that lets you manage the jobs in the village - another atrocity: no sorting, so way to see what the particular building is producing without clicking on details. The bigger the village the more this unmitigated disaster grows. \r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the horrendous coop: the host will lag like hell and for the client there will be unresponsive inputs and rubber banding galore. As a client, you press a hot key to switch to a weapon or tool from the bar and an sheathing animation plays but you still have the original tool or weapon equipped. Works just as bad from the wheel. \r\nAlso as a client, once the village is nice and big, it will barely load - like 4-5 minutes after spawning into the game the buildings are still not loaded in. If you plan to have anything bigger than two tents and shit-house in the village in coop, prepare yourself for 'fun times'.\r\n\r\nDo not recommend at this stag of development - it's not even at an honest beta. Check back once it's properly of early access unless you have high frustration tolerance, particularly in coop, For SP it works better, but it's boring as hell.",

The service the game uses can cope with some of the latency using anticipated values for actions, for example when you start chopping a tree it will eventually fall at a determined point. But when the results are synchronized, it can cause \"weird\" things like the rubberbanding you mention. The more latency there is, the worse it looks. A fast web connection to the service nearest server hub´for all players can reduce such effects drastically."

It's still got a long way to go to reach the depth and complexity of its precursor, but I can see small ways where it's actually improved over it (like being able to freely move any building without having to deconstruct and rebuild it). I'm looking forward to seeing it more feature complete, and more of MD's features being re-added to this game. I'd say the most obviously incomplete feature is that the Skill/Perk trees are in desperate need of fleshing out, they feel extremely placeholder at the moment.\n\nStill having fun though, but it's very much making me want to switch back the longer I go on. xD",

A long way to go, though.\n\n*Edit as of 1.0 - Well, it's improving, they definitely keep adding features and it seems to be going well. They do seem to be a bit premature with this whole 1.0 and \"release\" thing. They have a feature-set closer to a decent alpha or beta client rather than anything close to a 1.0 as it's used commonly, but, well, they're trying.",

            "review": "I admittedly have only about 10 hours of game time in Sengoku Dynasty, but based on a game that is still under development, I can make a positive recommendation to other players. \r\n\r\nTo be sure, there is a learning curve in some areas of the game, and trial-and-error in functions such as recruiting villagers and making sure they are fed and happy, can be frustrating at first. However, this game is not unlike many other sandbox oriented games, where trial-and-error and a lack of clear, step-by-step procedures make the word \"it's an adventure in itself\" a true statement. In other words, if you want your hand held, don't buy. If you don't mind slapping your forehead in that \"ah ha!\" moment, wanting then to restart a new game having suddenly mastered how you should build your village and plan for that first villager to settle, then this game definitely hits the target.  \r\n\r\nThe game itself is beautiful, and finishing an early quest of planting your bell tower in the ground before building an equally beautiful village, is a pretty cool thing.  The current pallet of wild animals keeps you on your toes, and will take your life if not careful.  Food and other resource management, as well as the progression of building structures available based on certain resource combinations,  are initially unclear, but become clearer when making mistakes turns to mastery-by-experimentation. I suspect these minor shrouds on game play dynamics will be lifted by the designers at some point.\r\n\r\nThe game has tremendous promise and as such I recommend it.  In some ways, the trial-and-error aspect of this game in my first 10 hours of playing it has felt familiar to how I learned how to play Valheim.  At some point in Valheim, I hit the \"now I understand moment\" on so many formerly frustrating issues. Like Valheim, and in some ways more so, Sengoku is a beautiful world, and the experience of founding and growing a village in this ancient era is pretty darn cool.",

            "review": "This is another \"with caveats\" recommendation. This game had the potential to be an excellent, realistic survival game set in Japan, during the Sengoku era. Then it got derailed into silly micromanaging your villagers. I know there are a lot of games that focus on balancing production with resources, and all that stuff. I don't really enjoy them. What I like is the feel of being in an environment, as realistically realized as possible. \r\n\r\nThis game has the same graphics (basically) as Medieval Dynasty. In other words, they're beautiful and they've done a good job emulating the landscape of Feudal Japan (at least, it feels right). There are dangers, such as bandits, bears, and wild boars to keep you on your toes. But then you run up against nonsense like not being able to assign one of your villagers to cutting wood, because there's no \"wood storage\" building in the village, and you're not allowed to put wood in the \"general storage\" or the \"food storage.\" (Throw the damned logs in a pile!!!) Worse, when you attempt to build the cursed thing, you discover that you can't build a \"wood storage\" until your village has a high enough reputation! \r\n\r\nI can't even. \r\n\r\nI know it's how micromanagement games work, but it's precisely why those games yank me out of the setting and make me want to play something ELSE. Still, it's engrossing and fun enough for me to have played it for 54 hours, and I intend to keep playing. So I'd still recommend it as a fun romp in feudal (extremely backwater) Japan. Don't expect it to look like Kyoto. Think more like \"Seven Samurai\" in the muddy, miserable village most of it takes place in. Also, there are no samurai or even ronin. Mostly peasants and bandits.",

            "review": "There are some gameplay differences from Medieval Dynasty, one of my favorite games and the only survival game I actually enjoy, but overall the experience can be summed up as Medieval Dynasty set in Japan with some new features. The artwork and setting are fantastic, the addition of shrines with time-limited bonuses make things more interesting, and the change in theme deserves commendation. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there are some bugs and stutters and long loading times. Starting the game in particular requires a surprisingly long loading sequence, and even with the video settings turned down as far as I can on a last-generation gaming laptop I still have stutters and temporary game freezes. I am, however, finding the story more compelling than Medieval Dynasty, with your character and your character's childhood friend being refugees who have to try and survive in a hostile new land that recently underwent a serf rebellion. There are different buildings required to make a self-sufficient village, and refugees are scattered throughout the land to be acquired for your settlement. \r\n\r\nOverall, if you like the idea of playing Medieval Dynasty but in Feudal Japan then this is the game for you. Some things don't translate directly, such as the project structures, and there are changes to the types of facilities available, but it is clear the developers wanted to expand upon what was available in their last game while simultaneously providing a time-period experience in a new setting. While I won't recommend this game to everyone, solely because the survival/simulator genre is not for everyone, I do highly recommend this to people interested in village-starting simulators based in feudal Japan. The Total War game was great for simulated feudal warfare, while this game is even better at letting the player create a town from nothing in the same setting. \r\n\r\nTL:DR;\r\n4/5 stars. Setting is amazing. Graphics fantastic but demanding. Long load times to start, occasional stuttering with last-gen gaming laptop. If you want a village-building simulator set in feudal Japan, this is IT. If you think your experience with Medieval Dynasty will directly translate to this game, prepare to be blindsided. I highly recommend to survival simulator enthusiasts, particularly those with an interest in the setting.",

The village management system, resource management, population management systems need to be improved greatly. But this game only came out less than a year ago and it is developed by a different company (Superkami) than the company that developed Medieval Dynasty (RenderCube). There is so much time for improvement. Medieval Dynasty took years to get to where it is and to get things like Co-op, whereas Sengoku already has Co-op built in. We can expect great things from Sengoku Dynasty. \n\nIf you aren't prepared for a beta gaming experience, then hold off on getting the game now. But I can tell you that Sengoku already has the makings of a great game. Much better than Medieval in terms of artwork, and early game mechanics and opportunities. Quests will get better, village building will get better. Things are looking up! I will continue to play both games as they both offer a unique experience.",

If you are thinking of having a village of hot Japanese girls/women think again all the refugees look alike and you can't even equip them. on top of that they all look about 50-60 years of age. the males look hella old to lol. It was a bit disappointing but maybe they'll fix it later on. Also you get no choice on who you play. You my friend are a sexy male that's nearly balding which almost ruined it save for the 1st person mode i play in at all times so i'm not reminded that i'm such a guy. at least let me choose to make my character. Still it's in early stages and i'll forgive it for now.  The game needs a bit of focus when it comes to quest. rather then a whole season to build a bridge make it days. in my case i played it on a custom setting of 60 days per season while the normal defualt is at 4 days per season. things like farming should be auto unlocked at the start of the game, and rice farm can be locked till you learn it since it isn't a normal common thing. Same with Iron mining and steel making work up to it. Other ores like copper and tin, lead and more. As soon as i made a forge i was able to make a katana -_- come on guys make me work for this put in a quest to unlock it. Same with steel making.",

The tutorial is poor-to-non-existent and the construction  of buildings is template driven. Graphics are decent but not compelling. \r\n\r\nThe game is a casual time-waster bot worth more than $25 at the high end.\r\n\r\nI gave up because I wasn't engaged in the game, story or objectives.",

You get a semblance of flavour and direction whilst still enjoying the sandbox elements.\r\n\r\nMusic - Appears culturally appropriate and keeps to the background well, hasn't irritated me yet which is impressive.\r\n\r\nGraphics - Not sure if I'm doing something odd with the settings or if it's by design, but they are a bit weird and blurry. The FPS sometimes drops whilst running, and my PC is fairly good. I am however sometimes a bit of an old man with computer things so watch videos rather than take my word for it. The scenery is definitely pretty either way.\r\n\r\nGameplay - Solid concepts with a good combination of building, exploring, and village management. Realistically you can choose what you want to really do as well to some extent. This is personal preference, but I felt like cutting down trees at the start is way too easy - I want to have to genuinely work to be able to build a house or it feels like it cheapens it. I'd like to see it start hard and have perks to make it easier later. The combat is fast and simple, and a lot of it relies on you knowing where a bandit is before they murder you. But I like that people can die in a couple of hits, you or them, as it adds to the realism. Although I'm surprised that a bandit with a spear sticking out of his face wouldn't look a little harder for the guy who threw it. Overall, I very much like what the devs have gone for here and look forward to seeing them build on it.\r\n\r\nBugs - Surprisingly for an early access game I only found a couple of very minor ones relating to an axe not hitting things until I re-equipped it and a false quest marker on the map solved by turning it on and off again. This game is fully playable as is, and I almost wasn't expecting that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I saw another review where someone was complaining about having stamina exist. I personally like it, but in the custom difficulty menu you have the option to remove it. So that's definitely not an issue. Quest locations are somewhat. I'd suggest the game add a couple more fast travel locations, as if you choose to build your first village somewhere else than your starting area, you'll have a lot more running than you want to do.\r\n\r\nOverall I like the direction the game is going. It definitely needs more content especially when it comes to perk trees which are incredibly boring and minimal right now. I'd also really like to see the ability to design your own houses, as you can make stunning villages with standard structures, but I think a building editor would add a fantastic design improvement. I really hope the devs keep at this and allow for modding later.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What's missing is a strong storyline. The goal is to build your village but it feels like it's nothing more than that, while the game talk alot about a \"dynasty\" and it's hard to get the \"I'm building my own dynasty\" feeling. I wish we could interact more with the other villages, in term of market for exemple or to be able to have a family (a bit like in Medieval Dynasty). Also, you cannot really \"choose a way\" (monk, warrior, etc.) as it claim because you can unblock each way and it doesn't seems to influence the storyline. Great game to pass time, but after 18hours I feel I just keep doing the same thing over and over without seeing real progress. \nHopefully it will keep developing in a good way since it have alot of potential. I will follow the updates for sure.",

Seems the refugees dont come to you now so you must go out and explore. The Dynasty leveling is more fleshed out and worth leveling now. \n\nThe game crashed twice over several hours. I think the load times were improved (when offline it \"searches for player data\" for a while, but online it doesn't do this and is quicker.\n\nThe AMD FSR is still broke and would turn off if i pause the game.  However, this time around i used TSR at 70% with loseless scaling and get a solid 60 fps. Minus some stuttering that I chalk up to my old GPU.  \n\nIf I had someone to play with, it would definitely be S tier. But even solo, it is fun.\n\nLooking forward to their future updates. This game will be really good. \n\n\nOld review:\nHas potential...  It's strong suits are: \n+Looks nice\n+Some dialogues are interesting\n+First Third Person village sim\n-Needs more to do, or maybe I didnt get far enough to figure out the game play loop. I think it'll shine if they plan on doing more with combat... but who knows how far off that is.\n\nFor me the nail in the coffin was performance issues. I went through the trouble shooting faq and did a bunch of things to try and address this. Managed to hit a good equilibrium of fidelity to FPS. I thought it was good, but just had another crash. I didn't realize it was going to be so unstable. This is a very foreign thing to me. \n\nCrashes every 20-30ish minutes without fail... So I've been saving often, but even going to the pause screen causes issues. Every time i pause AMD FSR turns off. On top of long load times to get the game running again...  very tedious. Not worth my time.\n\nIt's exhausting having to back track in game and troubleshoot. Once they address performance I'll try again. Unfortunately I went past refund period and don't feel like i got much out of it game play wise.  So... that's thumbs down.\n\nI hope they address this sooner rather than later. I've played better looking games that got much better performance. Just know what you're getting into. It needs more time in the oven.. I probably should of went with medieval dynasty instead unfortunately.\n\nGTX1080ti\nI7 7700k\n32 GB ram",

I would say the games UI is really good, weapon wheel access is easy and being able to create different items and different shelter items with the hammer. Starting tutorial is nice you should have a option to notify the player how many resources needed or catalog to show what resources are avaliable in the world like a Wiki. I like that the environment the player is in you can pick up all natural resources and the option of choices with the character dialogue. What I do not like is the CRAZY camera angles was quite annoying and also how quick the time changing effect in the game. The game kept crashing for me as well. I would also like be able to change my character prior to dropping in the world. But other than that the game does have potential, I got refunded but I will probably check the game out later.",

I have no problem playing much larger games like Baldur's Gate 3 on high settings so I didn't even check the min RAM thinking this game wouldn't cause any issues. I have a older gaming laptop with 8 RAM and SSD which I know is on the lower side, but this is the first time it's been an issue. Game seems great and I'm sure it will be optimized in the future, but just be warned if you think this game will work for you because similar games did\n\n\nEdit: I was able to play the game on a better computer and I've enjoyed it. Its definitely still a work in progress, but the game has potential with future updates. The current map is a little small and bare in some areas. The villagers consume way more than I can put out. I don't know the history of domesticated animals in Japan during this time period, but it would be nice to have some animals in the village and maybe some dialogue with the villagers too. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of different foragable plants and food, but alot of other features seem pretty bare bones. I look forward to future updates",

            "review": "I've played for nine hours and really want to be able to recommend this game but it is absolute garbage in its current state. Toplitz is making bank off of the 'Dynasty' title when Medieval Dynasty is the only good game in the franchise. \r\n\r\nThe performance is awful and you can read the horror stories in other reviews but honestly there really isn't anything promising about the game at all aside from the general concept of a Sengoku period 'Dynasty' title ON PAPER. The dialogue is so amateurish that it's immersion breaking at times reading text that almost sounds like modern day teenagers talking. There are a handful of good musical tracks but the animations are the worst and the \"water-color\" style just come off as cheap. The music is also inconsistent and doesn't align with the weird cut-scenes. The model work and textures seem fine but there's nothing that really makes the game stand out at the moment. The character animations are terrible and sluggish most of the time and the amount of heads disappearing from characters randomly is comical. \r\n\r\nYou have the option to play in either Third-Person or FPS but they haven't seemed to figure out how to make that work with the movement, building and combat. In FPS your character will frequently engage in a strange climbing animation that will cause your head to detach from your body and spin around so that you watch your torso and limbs \"climb\" up rocks and obstacles behind you though it makes zero sense because you can't \"climb\" over anything more than maybe 2 ft tall. In Third Person mode you have the issue of not being able to target properly. For some reason switching between modes seems to affect hitboxes for items and enemies. It's a strange problem that I don't even know how to better describe. It's most noticeable when it comes to building placement which is one of the biggest problems I have with the game.\r\n\r\nThe building placement is absolutely the worst aspect of the game after performance. The restrictions on where you can build and what can and can't obstruct placement is arbitrary at best. You can have a giant completely vacant lot with no foliage or objects in sight but for some reason you can only place a tiny building at a specific angle. This is SOMEHOW affected by your camera view as well! Sometimes you can't even place a building unless you switch to Third Person and vice versa. To top all that off sometimes when you initially place the building it will rotate it 90 degrees and now you have a door facing the wall of another building and the only way to fix it is to start over again which can take a LOT of time when trying to line things up in this HORRENDOUS system. There is no reason why there can't be some sort of means by which to align buildings in this game. Either that or they need to be FAR more forgiving with clipping. This especially rings true considering how difficult it is to even place an item. Half the time the 'placeholder' that you set down when you decide to build something doesn't even visually match what it turns into when you construct it leading to stairs and doors being in unwanted places. Did I mention you don't get your resources back once you've placed the flooring down which has to be completed BEFORE the game reveals to you that your building has been rotated? It also wastes hammer durability building and re-building. It wouldn't be that big of an issue if you could freely move doors and windows which you sometimes can and sometimes can't!\r\n\r\nWith all that out of the way I think the biggest problem with the game to me personally is that it doesn't feel Japanese at all. The icon for the game is just fake Kanji and it really symbolizes the crux of the issues with the aesthetics: this is a game that is trying to LOOK like it takes place in Sengoku era Japan. What the game is desperately missing and I suspect won't ever be fixed is that the game doesn't FEEL like it takes place in Japan at all. It feels like a cheap asset pack using the Medieval Dynasty engine with some lite nods to Japanese culture thrown in to pander to a western audience. It's so off-putting at times that I can't help but wonder who exactly involved in the development of this game is the one in charge of adapting Japanese culture because I find it hard to believe it's anyone with anything more than a superficial knowledge of Japan and access to Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nIt will take a LOT of work to fix the problems with this game. I know Toplitz games are notorious for poor optimization because I was barely able to run Medieval Dynasty when it launched but I'm fairly sure the gameplay mechanics can be fixed at least when it comes to building placement since it's a pivotal part of the game. The one thing that I will remain skeptical of until I see otherwise is the general vibe and aesthetic of the game. \r\n\r\nThe most recent Kintsugi Update released with a trailer that is almost comically unaware of itself. Kintsugi is the art of repairing broken pottery with golden lacquer yet you have to carry 5 axes on you at all times because they're constantly breaking and you have to build new ones rather than repair the one you have. An update based on the theme of repairing broken items in a game that won't let you repair broken items. They also state that they chose the Sengoku setting because it was a time in Japanese history when anyone could become a daimyo. This is an absolutely ridiculous justification for placing a game in this era and is clearly just using the words Sengoku and daimyo because of their popularity in Japanese media and subsequent export to other countries. They make it sound like it was a period of upward mobility and social advancement when in reality it was a consolidation of power between multiple warring factions that bathed the land in blood. This game could take place at any point in feudal Japan with the premise of just being a refugee of war starting a village in the middle of nowhere yet they went with a false pretense. The decision-making at Toplitz is baffling.",

These again are almost unmanagable in case of needs (food, warmth, hygene, etc.)\n\nI like the game, but I feels like the recent updates didn´t even target bugs that exist over half an year or expand the possibilities of gameplay.\n\nMaybe someday it will achieve the full beauty I wish it to be",

By that I mean, parts of the map aren't just unfinished, but busted, arrows will get stuck in air, NPC pathing and behaviors are very poor (would almost serve the game better if they were static), structures cannot be placed next to each other in a manner that looks natural, and (I know this sounds inconsequential but is an enormous peeve) none of the buildings have functioning doors, that's to name the most glaring issues. \r\nThe game does have a few things going for it in its current state though. The devs have taken a lot of care to make the environment atmospheric and beautiful, they've also done a good job of describing mechanics in the game so it's not a headache to learn (mostly). I do think they should canvas their players to see what mechanics remain unclear so they can address that in future updates.\r\nStill, the game was released way too early even for early access and would have been better funded through a kickstarter.",

At the moment, the atmosphere is there, they just need to make it smoother game play - which is why everyone else probably doesn't want to grind in a prototype game at the moment. It was fun, but it got boring and had to stop playing after a little bit.

And you are forced to choose one of them when you hit the family stuff.  Meanwhile the NPC men around town are young and have full heads of hair.  What's up with that?\n\nI notice a lot of the same issues with combat gameplay as before.  The creatures and bandits are still overpowered and I still wander around with GOD mode Health and Stamina.  Because its boring struggling for breath and taking hours to walk anywhere...and having nothing to do because you can't hunt, or explore if everything kills you.\n\nThe menus are terrible.  You have 'prerequisites' to build objects, but you cut the 'required ingredient label' all off with ... so I can't tell WHICH log I'm supposed to use for construction.  And I can never guess the right one, so I can't use those decorations...at all.  Why don't you ghost these decorations like the buildings.  So I can build it the same way?\n\nEverything gets gated behind the 'smithy'....so I get stuck at a point where I can't progress and I'm waiting on construction of a particular watchtower to unlock the tool I need to gather it.\nYou unlock it, then you need to make a BRONZE tool, but you can't SMELT bronze without the Smith.  So how DO you get the Smithy?\n\nI have CLAY right across the river from my city, but I need a 'regional source' to gather it.  But I've conquered regions where its present.  Same with Bamboo.  My dynasty OWNS the region it can be gathered in.  Why would I want to MAKE ANOTHER village somewhere else?  I can send workers for special projects in places I do NOT have regional ownership of.  Why can't I send workers to places I do own to gather MY resources?\n\nThe menus appear to have delays updating 'village resource requirements'  so I'll be at a point where I'm good on food...then change one thing, suddenly it says I'm massively failing.  I only took away FIVE fish.  Where did my food production all go?  \n\nThere's still some minor visual glitches with the winter snow layer....and weird lags....but otherwise it appears to be playable.  Just...frustrating and impossible without God Mode.  I guess I'm just a GOD HERO now.\n\nI got a 'Fatal Error' game crash TWICE.  Both during season changes while they were finish a construction project.  After (Spring-> Summer year 2, claiming Enjiro Rebels) which it just keeps crashing and I can't continue playing.  Loading back, I had to SLEEP through the change of season for it to let me to continue.\n\nI think it needs a bit more work before I can recommend it to other players.",

I have had more NPCs with broken animations, Load times are still horribly long despite the update log saying they are reduced, Player Character animations break more then I've seen since I started a new save and in general this major update just brought minor aspects to the game that it needed prior. Nothing stunning. We now have farming, Player character now has needs, and you get more buildings for town, also a ton of bugfixes. \n\nWhile this is great progress I would save your money, buy or keep playing Medieval Dynasty and advise Toplitz Productions, who I believe are the publishers of these Dynasty titles to focus on one or two game titles and Quality control before pumping out another Dynasty game as they have 4-5 Dynasty titles now including this one and Medieval Dynasty. All with varying degrees of quality and or partial completed-ness. \n\nThis game has a ton of potential, but at the rate its going and with how many games Toplitz keeps shitting out as quick as possible, This game wont be seeing 1.0 for a long time and if it does it won't be where it should be. I really hope im wrong.",

The combat is trash and I don't think damage output changes with different weapons, let alone armour in regards to protection changes.\r\n\r\nFix the bugs and work on whats above and I might come back to it.

Now we have this, a old timey Western one with awful reviews, and a Vampire one coming out later this year.

Game systems quarter baked\n3. Hot keys on screen doing nothing without clicking the button with a mouse\n4.

Yes it's survival, does not mean make the game menial & time consuming for literally no benefit.\n\nI really want to love this game but I cannot. \n\nThe good:\n - Visual(landscapes, buildings etc *not the animations or characters themselves)\n - Building presets(I do not think this is the best way but the presets are really nice & it does simplify much of the game)\n - Audio\n\nThe issues I personally have:\n - No customization\n - Poor tutorial & misleading(The tell you to build your belltower to start a base & that you can explore/run around the world to build anywhere so I jet off running and find a nice spot to build but then you have to keep returning to the tutorial guy in town)\n - Animations\n - Stamina: First of all devs need to stop making stamina that hinders the player for no real reason.  This game has a small stamina bar & everything requires stamina,  trying to place objects/build/gather resources prepare to have to stop and wait constantly.\n - Resource Gathering: Let's look at wood/cutting trees.   there are 3 different variants of wood you can & must gather all from the same trees(1 resource node). As a baseline 1/3 for node->material is bad.   You cut down a tree(which with stone axe at start of the game requires your full stamina bar, then you wait for stamina and use your axe again twice to split into logs(1/3).  You switch to your Adze & debark the logs getting Debarked logs(2/3) & finally you use the Adze again to get Planks(3/3).   You require to gather numerous of each of these resources so be prepared to woodcut for the first while, although logs among a few other resources don't stack which clogs your inventory and you better know where to find bamboo & run all over the place to gather various resources to build storage as well.      Nodes are often far & wide & you will be running->gathering by yourself *always*(see the above notes about stamina because you also cannot do this quick as your stamina drains in about 3-4s of sprinting).\n - Inventory: The inventory itself is alright. no weight limit just space limit however the lack of hotkeys I believe is just lazy.  You must right click & select options of items in your inventory. When your inventory is full & you harvest/gather something it just disappears :(\n\nHope they make QoL changes going forward.   I look forward to revisiting this game when it gets more updates.",

My biggest complaint being the main gameplay loop is craft a tool, use that tool to gather resources, place down a prebuilt ghost building. Then stand there with a hammer while you deliver the resources necessary to complete sections of the building. Its the most boring approach to building I could possibly imagine. And sure as you progress you unlock more buildings for more tools and even eventually get villagers that can do some of the work for you but the grind to get there is almost unbearable. I hope they add more, and eventually some kind of conflicts in the game, but right now its pretty barebones, bland, lacking features and the systems are poorly explained.",

That alone is a good and bad thing- it's easy to get sucked in and motivated to work on your village. Although the quests could have had more variants to them other than it being building quests and getting your village to a certain level, maybe add some relationships and such, but the game is as said still in early access. \n\nThe mechanics are easy, hunting and gathering or cooking food for your villagers is so far easy peasy. (This might change with the next major update though). I like the graphics but it does need polishing, my computer is also a bit outdated so my view on the graphics might not be 100% accurate I suppose. \n\nAll in all, I enjoy it and I am really excited to see what is to come and really hope we get som more fun quests!",

This game has been in early access for quite some time and they are just NOW implementing game changing material that will erase everything you have done if you actually want to play the game with updates from now on. I can, in no way, endorse a game that is not in Alpha and has server resets after 6-8 months of early access because \"they screwed up\". Early access does allow of course for anything to happen. So essentially this is my fault for trusting the developer to put out a \"somewhat finished product in no need of a complete overhaul\". I'm sorry if I'm just old fashioned but a game shouldn't do this unless it wants to die. Alpha>Beta>Early Access>Launch. This game went Alpha>Early Access>game wipe>. Great way to kill yet another game! So glad this game had such terrible reviews lately and I was able to snag it for cheap anyways lol. I feel.... less cheated on? :-P",

Especially for the sake of \"spoilers\" updates arent a 1920's burlesque show. They are supposed to explain something. no one wants to be teased we want information so we can make decisions. if it wasnt for waiting around to see if a simple qol thing would ever get answered after three months of asking id have taken my money back.\n\nWith the kintsugi major update: The season automatically changing has been removed. but only for easy modes. this was the qol issue i was mentioning. people asked for options to set the length or remove the automatic change. however, i find it ridiculous we couldn't be told before now that this was the plan. (its a band-aid solution and not what people were asking for exactly, but it accomplishes the goal)\n\nim still not changing the recommendation, im holding the behavior chosen as responsible for this.\nHowever, i will say i will be able to play the game much further now, and i will probably begin to enjoy it.",

I am the sole provider, sole woodcutter, sole miner, sole explorer, farmer, etc. I spend more time youtubing where I'm going wrong. Where to find things. because exploring the map is an actual chore. I think it would help to hear another person's voice. So much reading...and so many names. Characters just hosing you down with their personal shit when you just need to figure out which village your in. Survival Crafting and even Tim/Resource Management is my jam but not this. I loved the idea of the game but sadly not the results. Maybe I'm too dumb for this game but everything was confusing and no fun at all. At least for me. I envy those that can get enjoyment out of this. Hmm...some positives: I liked harvesting rocks, trees, berries, shrubs, and finding eggs. their sounds were great. That part was fun. The first 2 hours were fun. But venturing out of the initial village...everything sort of lost its luster and became more like work. Also, I was stuck in level 6 for the longest time. Unable to unlock anything even though I was supposed to be able to....that sucked.",

Cons: There are many similarities to old school Elder Scrolls from 2014 without it being even nearly as good. Menus are sluggish and cumbersome, items made of steel unrealistically disintegrate the same as items made of stone, interactions with npc's are boring and mostly meaningless, community storage lacks adequate space and does not increase as you progress, you will find objects flying up in the air. This list of cons could go on and on but there are also many pros to be excited about. Pros: You will be busy! There are many aspects to growing your dynasty and just providing basics like food and tools is almost a full time job. With no way to control the speed or duration of seasons, good time management is essential. Build modes are fun and include some decorations so that you can add a personal touch to your village(s). You can start up three new villages with 20 npc's in each. Gardening has been a great addition to the game and offers a lot of various items for food production. Most productions are well balanced and make use of all products with little to no waste. Hopefully there is a lot more to come for Sengoku Dynasty.",

The map exists, but there isn't much to do other than run around. the questline is just a linear series of NPCs asking you to get things/talk to people. building is cool, but difficult to do on any type of sloped terrain. Realistically, I stretched it about 6-8 hours before I had nothing left to do.\n\nThere is also an issue causing a lot of players to crash due to the game using DirectX 12 in the UE5 engine. It's a known bug, and rolling back to DX11 would fix it, but the devs haven't implemented the fix. I haven't experienced the crash myself, but it's kind of odd for them not to attempt the fix or communicate about it at all.",

This apparently got Dead End all butt hurt lol but it now works! The dev's have fixed it so that it is no longer crashing. I wasn't able to playtest the game at all initially and now I'm having a hard time not playing it! The dev's have done great work and I can't wait to see the game in its official release state! So @Raz, yes it's now fixed so you can play it! @kits_meow, I answered your question above as well. @Dead End, I do appreciate being called a kid again, makes me feel good in my 30's lol. Overall, everyone, I'm really glad that the devs on this team have corrected this issue and now all are free to enjoy the game in it's early access state!\n\nUpdate to the Update:\nHey guys, I had changed my negative review to a positive one and I've since been enjoying the game quite a bit. However, it seems that didn't reflect here so for that I apologize. It should be showing as a positive review with a thumbs up now. To @SwordsOfTheSouth I appreciate you reaching out as well. I have been enjoying the game since they fixed the compatibility between UE5's Shader Model 6 and DirectX12. The game looks amazing and I really do enjoy it now. I removed my initial review post. I can't wait to see how your team develops it further! Kanpai!",

When I first played Sengoku I was awestruck by the visuals and how I could explore such a beautiful world. It is a fun game and the overall art style of Sengoku looks more hand-crafted than that of Medieval Dynasty (I own both games now and like both). Sengoku is actually what first got me into survival/builder games. It has great visuals, consistent updates, and is fun to play as you expand your village. I just got to four villagers now so I am not at end-game but I've enjoyed it nonetheless. The entry of a Japan-style game in the survival/builder game scene was unique and a necessity. I am looking forward to more combat opportunities the game devs have said they will implement- which would make it a notable departure from MD.\n\nIt's different from MD and doesn't have the kinship elements yet but I feel like the game overall will be more action/adventure focused which is a positive to me.",

Despite being in early access, the game has already made a strong impression, offering a captivating blend of strategy, resource management, and historical immersion.\n\nThe game's strategic depth is impressive, allowing players to carefully manage their resources, develop their settlements, and build powerful armies. The combat system is equally engaging, featuring a mix of real-time and turn-based mechanics that add an extra layer of complexity and strategy.\n\nThe historical setting is well-realized, with detailed environments, authentic characters, and a rich storyline that brings the Sengoku era to life. The game's artwork and music are also top-notch, adding to the immersive experience.\n\nWhile there are still some rough edges and bugs to be ironed out, Sengoku Dynasty is a promising early access title that has the potential to be a major hit. I highly recommend checking it out if you're a fan of strategy games, historical simulations, or just want to experience the thrill of feudal Japan firsthand.",

Technically, all games are a waste of time, but any that make you deeply aware of that fact have a problem.\n\nI suspect this problem may be more pronounced as I'm an older gamer and so my game time is reduced and feels far more valuable and, perhaps this is you too.\n\nIf you want a game that makes you acutely aware of the sands of time leaking through your clenched fist as your weekend evaporates, or a game that subconsciously prods you to mow the lawn just so you can look at yourself in the mirror later, this is the game for you.",

Birds, squirrels and all matters of wild animals used to call that place home.\nThen, a single and very strong willed shipwrecked man decided he would take over a burnt village. Trees started to fall one by one in the very few time he was around. \nLegends say he didn't even stop to sleep. He cut, and cut and built, and built.\nTwo days later a small village appeared, but it was no longer surrounded by nature. \nOne could imagine his destruction would stop there. But no, he wasn't satisfied just yet. \nA villager heard him say \"Bamboo. I need to go cut Bamboo.\" mumbling by himself. The bamboo forest's spirits trembled in fear and prepared to face his primitive, ever breaking axes.\nAnd the ever-watching goddess of destiny, with her quirky voice with a weak \"r\", (Burose-Finu) was heard from her shrine saying \"I can't wait for character customization and my crazy nature's destroyer's background to be decided.\"",

The graphics are truly captivating, and the underlying storyline is nothing short of amazing. However, after investing a considerable amount of time, I find myself at a point where there's little left to do. The quests have dwindled, and avenues to level up my village are scarce. It feels like I've hit a standstill.\n\nGames are meant to offer a sense of completion, but in this case, finishing a village seems elusive due to the lack of missions and engaging possibilities. Regrettably, my journey with this game may be coming to an end. I yearn for a significant update that breathes new life into the gameplay; a revival that would compel me to return.\n\nMoving forward, I'll approach new gaming experiences with caution. The allure of a captivating YouTube gameplay video may not be a reliable indicator, especially when they are from several months ago. It appears that the concerns voiced by players then remain unaddressed, raising questions about the commitment of the developers to enhance the game. Considering the investment involved, I hope for positive changes that would make the game worth revisiting.",

The game is smooth and glitch free. I have over a thousand hours in Medieval Dynasty and this game has a few differences that I like. The landscape is more colorful with flowering plants, shrubs and trees. The artwork at the beginning of the game and at the completion of special projects provides a different look. Special projects is how you gain dynasty points and unlocks new tools and recipes. This makes sense to me because it connects the improvement of the valley infrastructure (bridges and watch towers) with your character development. The only cons I have at this point are Load Game doesn't work for me. There is a lack of game customization and perks at this point but it is early access and I expect will improve with further development.\nThis game is definitely worth a look and the investment.",

Graphics clip sometimes, it's slow to load, and the equipment/crafting/building systems aren't intuitive and feel clunky at first. You get used to it. Some places where it is logical that you could walk or climb don't let you and you can get stuck too easily on small obstacles; that can get frustrating. There isn't a clear explanation for doing a lot of stuff, but you can figure it out if you pay attention. The small details are gorgeous, and while the dialogue is pretty scripted, it's believable, which helps with the immersion. I feel like the job system could be streamlined/simplified in so far as people. It takes one person per station, so you end up needing too many people to handle farming, for instance, in my opinion, especially when you consider it takes a full season to receive production items. The main thing I really want to see is a chat function for multi-player. Not being able to communicate in-game with other players is unacceptable for a paid game, early access or not.",

I like the idea that you can regrow new trees after you cut them down for resources.  I've been doing zazen for 50 years and I hope there will be some focus and teaching of such spiritual methods for the villagers ( actually the game players) in the game.\nI would like to see the addition of a tea house and koi pond for the villages.\nI would like to be able to push a button to look down at the village area from above to show the area and borders of the village and allow better planning for building locations, perhaps even to be able to place  images of the various buildings in that window so that when a building is completed it will automatically be placed in that location.\nThat's all I have for now.

            "review": "(Note: My review is from before the 1.0 release and I am leaving the original review content up for comparison)\n\nI can't really even play the game because the sound and frames stutter constantly, but that said, the few seconds I managed to spend in the game (before giving up) looked really nice. Being a fan of Medieval Dynasty, I'm looking forward to this one being in an actually playable and more in depth state.\n\n--------\n\nUpdate: Since I last attempted to play this game some months back, it has definitely improved a great deal. I am actually able to play the game without it just constantly being at 2 frames a second (no part of my PC has been upgraded since then so it's wholly the game that has improved its optimization and performance).\n\nThere is quite a lot to build and manage in this game, and while there is combat, it does feel a little clunky at times, but it isn't like.... BAD combat. Just takes some getting used to. There is quite a lot of land to cover as well, and you can eventually build a village in most - if not all - of the different regions and each region has its own unique resources, special projects, or other objectives and such to do.\n\nI haven't gotten very far yet, but I'm not sure if things such as horses, combat companions (so that you're not just always fighting alone) and other things like that are in it. If not, it'd be cool if they were to really make it feel like you're trying to become a leader of an entire valley that you otherwise travel by foot or defend alone.",

Tired of the ceaseless conflicts orchestrated by samurais and daimyos, *insert name here* harbored a dream – to create a haven where people could rebuild their lives far from the reach of swords and chaos. With a resolute spirit, he embarked on a quest to establish his own kingdom, beginning with the revival of a scorched village site.\n\n*insert name here*'s journey started at the remnants of a once-thriving community now reduced to ash by the flames of war. The village, once called Sosogi, had been erased from the maps, its people scattered like leaves in the wind. Undeterred, *insert name here* saw potential in the desolation, envisioning a sanctuary that would rise from the ashes and embody the resilience of those who had endured loss.\n\nGathering displaced souls who shared his vision, *insert name here* and his fellow refugees transformed the scorched earth. They cleared debris, planted new life in the fertile soil, and erected simple homes amidst the charred ruins. The reborn village was christened Sosogi, a symbol of both its tragic past and the hopeful future being woven by its inhabitants.\n\nWord of Sosogi's restoration spread, drawing more displaced souls seeking refuge. The once-desolate village became a beacon of hope, a testament to the indomitable spirit that could thrive even in the aftermath of destruction. *insert name here*, now a leader among equals, guided the community with wisdom and compassion, forging bonds stronger than the flames that had razed the village before.\n\nAs the seasons turned, the scars of war faded, replaced by blooming orchards, bustling workshops, and the laughter of children echoing through the rejuvenated streets. Sosogi, once a symbol of despair, emerged as a living testament to the transformative power of collective resilience.\n\nEmboldened by the success of Sosogi, *insert name here* expanded his vision, venturing into war-torn landscapes where hope seemed but a distant memory. Each new village he established carried the name of its tragic origin, a reminder that even from the darkest chapters of history, new beginnings could arise.\n\n*insert name here*'s dream of a peaceful kingdom, rooted in the revival of a burned-down village, became a beacon for those yearning to rebuild their lives. Through unwavering determination and a commitment to reclaiming the past, *insert name here* and his fellow refugees fashioned a tapestry of villages, each rising from the ashes to stand as a testament to the enduring power of hope, community, and the simple dream of a better life.\n\n- Chronicles of an AI,\n16th Century AD\n\n\nOh, and it worked well on Windows 11 23H2 as of 27 Jan 2024\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-9400F CPU @ 2.90GHz   2.90 GHz\n24,0 GB RAM\nRTX 3060 Ti - Driver version 546.65",

Most settings were preset to \"Epic\" and I lowered them to \"High\". This didn't make too much of a difference so I lowered to \"Medium.\"\nMedium settings still would not allow my FPS to exceed 75 out of my max 120 allowed.\nThe GPU had calmed down when standing idle but would spike to around 90% when moving the camera.\nOpening the menu oddly made my GPU spike and stay at almost 100% again. Not  sure why a menu is forcing my card to work harder than the game itself.\n\nMy Rig:\nIntel Core i7 11th Gen 11700KF\nNvidia GeForce 3080\n32 Gigs of RAM\nRunning off an SSD\n\nOptimize your damn game.",

It is a lot of picking berries and hacking trees down, but when I just want to sit at my desk, sip a drink, and do something easy that has a story line for me to follow, this game fits the bill.    I'm only running a 3080 TI OC and have the graphics cranked to the highest setting and everything runs smooth, so no complaints there.  However, I wouldn't waste the cash on buying the strategy guide like I did .  it hasn't been updated since May 2023, but the game sure has, so it's not very helpful.  i think as the Devs see this feedback from players they will make some changes and make the game better, but overall I wasn't mad about spending $20 on it during the winter sale.",

I can't believe how different both games are.\n\nLightning is horrible, it's always dark except few hours sun is directly above and no brightness option available. Performance is bad and FPS drops occasionally. Animations and flow feels like an indie survival-builder shovelware. Sound is clunky, especially rivers sound terrible. There are tons of missing things, but especially lack of furniture is annoying. Skills are lacking, no proper game options available, Dynasty tab feels like it's in alpha stages. Even MD had some opportunities on managing resources but this one doesn't have anything proper.\n\nI wish they just reskinned MD instead of creating a whole new game. I can say it has years of development to reach levels of MD unfortunately.",

            "review": "I was extremely critical of this when I first got it. For good reason. It has improved immeasurably since then but I would argue is still in early access. Like 'early access' was really a glorified alpha, this isn't a finished game. That said, the graphics are a lot better, it doesn't eat all of my processing power, and there are far more mechanics than there were in early access. \n\nWhat I like\nStuff like freeing regions and weapons added a lot of extra stuff to do. There are far more things to build and the village mechanics have become more interesting in their variety.\n\nWhat still isn't great\nSome of the combat is odd. Arrows will get stuck in the air for seemingly no reason. It still doesn't look as good as Medieval Dynasty, nor does it feel as immersive. The new mechanics add interesting stuff but they all feel very shallow. While there are more buildings things feel a bit same-y. \n\nWould I buy it now? Maybe if it was £15 or so. Probably not full price.",

The only major bug ive found is when finishing a cutscene with the masked lady in winter all the snow is gone and just looks really weird. Cannot wait for them to release more updates. I really hope they stick with story and npcs with quests because I was suprised how interesting the npcs in villages were they all had a story to tell or a viewpoint on a common topic throughout the game. This game is playable now in its current state and id say its worth the sale price of about $20 maybe even the full price tbh its honestly one of the best early access games ive ever played and considering how new it still is with only one major update its impressive and other companys should start releasing early access games that are this polished and functioning.",

The building mechanics are not as customary, nor is the perks, in fact the perks are dreadfully short, but maybe it will get better as I progress? Also there are limited custom settings, whereas, MD had a ton of custom settings.\n\nHowever, I would recommend this game still, the quests are fun and progress the building mechanics. Although a very different game then MD, there are small similarities, such as the combat is the same, the throwing of the spear is the same and interesting. If you have never played MD, then this game will be a treat. As you progress through the quests you open up new builds and recipes. Good luck storming the bandit camps!",

I'm super excited to see future updates as this has potential to be a fantastic staple for anyone's steam library. I think the UI in this is better and easier to use vs. Medieval Dynasty.\n\nWhat I'm most anticipating for future updates is a more in depth skill tree for character leveling. It's off to a good start, but 20 hours in and I've already unlocked all the perks available so far with exception of the monk category. A wagon for moving logs to the village from nearby forests would be pretty sweet too as one log takes a whole slot of inventory and these buildings take a lot!\n",

My husband and I play multiplayer and honestly they have the best E.A. multiplayer we have been in a LONG LONG time. We don't get kicked or have stalls, jittering, lag spikes, and no kicking like crazy (have yet to be kicked at all actually and we have played 6 hrs straight together) so other then the normal small issues for an E.A. this game is doing well. there are loads to do and learn for village management. the game can get better as it goes along.",

This game has promise towards being a game I come back to playing a lot and there are some fun elements that I have been enjoying. There are a few things that after 8 hours I look forward to seeing changed or optimized.  The quest log is too big and takes up a lot of screen space when the instructions are long, the game gets laggy for me when it gets dark, combat (I've only used spears and bows) seems designed to kill you haha I want to win sometimes. Some of the dialog is the npc just repeating back to you what you said, not sure if that is intentional. I would like to know what a building is going to require before I start building so that I don't have to keep running back and forth to storage or to chop more trees down. All in all though, I am looking forward to updates in the future.",

            "review": "My \"Rant\" about the \"Control Scheme\" situation. \n This game is unplayable, for me. Honestly, I lasted maybe an hour before the controller controls became too much. Also, st least 1/3 of that time in the game was only because I REALLY wanted to play that world. Another 1/3 was spent in menus trying to look up the control for a specific action, and/or just in the pause menu trying to ponder their choices in control bindings as I cursed the game. I enjoy Medieval Dynasty, and the world of Sengoku looked to be a good play. However, I just can't do it in the present control state for controller. \n   The controls just make NO SENSE, to me. I play Medieval Dynasty and the controls are, in general, logical, and you can re-nap as necessary. It's almost as if they had 2 hats, one with control buttons written on papers, and one with what the control does in-game written on papers, and they just had someone draw one from each hat, then put them together, to decide how they would bind your controls for you. It makes little sense, and not only that, but it makes NO SENSE to not simply lay out the controls in a recognizable fashion from the Medieval Dynasty game. Right now, the controls in Sengoku seem fuddled, confused, non user-friendly, counter intuitive, jumbled, and a complete Mess. Even when in comparison with the typical \"Left-Stick Click for sprint\" choice that is general for most games, this game says...\"Nah, let's make it as confusing as possible, and make left-stick click bring up your radial menu, which was sprint in Medieval Dynasty, and sprint in most games, in general.\" It's almost as if they actually went out of their way to make the controls as confusing, and annoying, as possible. \n    Go to sprint - open your radial menu to choose tool or weapon. Go to open radial menu - change camera view. Press \"Y\" on the controller in Sengoku it brings up the crafting menu, in Medieval Dynasty it sheathes/draws your tool or weapon. I equate their controls to the real world, but whenever you want to take a step with your left foot, you have to tell your brain to move your right arm, otherwise you will do some weird dance then just sit down. You have to re-wire your brain to illogical actions, and ones not even in line with the previous game in any way, much less the general and typical bindings of sprint, and other such bindings. \n    It's like going from a racing game, to a flight simulator, sure, some of the buttons will be used on both, but for different things, in different ways causing a giant collection of actions you didn't intend, eventually either crashing your plane into a mountain, or driving your car into the nearest tree. These aren't really \"different\" genres of games though...they are basically the same games, with almost the same mechanics, same objectives, just different maps/worlds. It makes NO SENSE to have the layout as they did. It's NOT just that the buttons are illogically completely different than Medieval Dynasty, but they are often completely illogically different than the general usage, overall. \n      Oh, and the Right Trigger...ya, don't expect to attack anything, not sure why, but the right bumper is the \"attack\" button. The left trigger still \"aims,\" but instead of then \"firing\" with the right trigger (another GENERAL choice in games, and even their other game \"Medieval Dynasty\"), you are supposed to use the right button. Seriously? As a matter of fact, the right trigger now has NO USE whatsoever in-game, except for changing menu tabs. It is not even shown as bound to ANYTHING for actual play while running around the game world, as I saw in the settings. \n     Maybe it's just me, but to go out of your way to not only ignore and defy the logical and \"general\" options of most games' typical controls (Sprint, Fire/Attack, etc.), but to also ignore and defy one of your OWN game's general and typical controls, just seems stupid, and makes a game that could otherwise be very enjoyable, a complete mess of jumbled, counter-intuitive, and illogical controls, which leads to undesired actions and consequences in-game. It's almost as if they just became in a hurry, and someone said...\"Who cares...just bind crap to do stuff, so we can sell it.\" \n      Maybe if you've never picked up and played with a controller, and never played Medieval Dynasty, or many other games offering general default logical sprint and attack bindings (left-stick click = sprint, right trigger = attack/shoot, etc.) this wouldn't be an issue. However if you've ever used a controller, you know the typical sprint, crouch, etc., in general, and when it is not only changed to something else, but seemingly illogically bound to something...you become not only incapable of efficient play, but you end up trying to bring up the radial menu by the animal you want to chase down, instead of sprinting at it, THEN watching it run off as you think: \"What was the sprint button in Sengoku again? WHY is it left bumper instead of left-stick click?! WHY is it forced bound to left bumper instead of left-stick click?!..and WHY didn't I attack/shoot when I squeezed the Right Trigger?!!!!! FFS!\" \n      Then, the final blow to any logic...is to not have the option to re-bind, which the game currently doesn't have, and which would solve much of the issue instantly. \n      Game world looks good. I can't say much else, because by the time I spent the effort to try to re-learn the typical/general controls of controller binding,  & completely different controls from their other game, & after many \"wtf?! being blurted out just when I thought I had \"re-bound\" my brain to work with their new control scheme that I can't change at all...I woke up on the floor in a pool of my own urine, couldn't remember my own name, & had a death grip on my controller like it owed me money. I think I had a stroke. Also, I then forgot their control scheme for Sengoku Dynasty, again...so I gave up, and played something else. \n      Seriously...\"Wtf?\" At least give me the ability to re-bind, and fix YOUR horrible control scheme, Devs.  Until this big issue (\"big\" to me, makes it unplayable unless I want to play ONLY this game and forget how to play most others) is resolved, I can't play this game properly, or efficiently, or enjoyably. If I can't...then I also can't recommend it to others. \n     If you have no issues with the controls, then good for you, i'm happy for you. That is NOT, and was NOT, my experience, and my experience is NOT YOUR experience, apparently. To me, they (controls) make no sense, no matter how I try to rationalize them, whether in comparison to the \"typical & general,\" OR even their other game (Medieval Dynasty) that I play, and enjoy. To each their own, but my opinions, and experience with Sengoku Dynasty was like being in a Train Wreck, then running over to it the train car with the highest flames, and throwing myself inside the burning wreckage. Just Painful...\n\n*NOTE*: Another  issue I want to mention: When using the \"A\" button to select \"quit game,\" it pops up the box asking for confirmation, but only for a split second. The box comes up, but doesn't halt the quitting of the game, it is just a quick pop-up followed by the game just shutting down. Obviously if you click on \"quit game\" PURPOSELY you want to quit the game. However, the intention of the confirmation-box pop-up is for those whom accidentally click on it, which occurs for any number of reasons (some the fault of the game in my opinion), to then allow you to confirm you didn't accidentally click on \"quit game.\" Obviously if the game is simply popping the confirmation box up for a split second, and requiring NO confirmation action on your part, then the game shuts down a second after, it is NOT \"working as intended.\" So, be careful what you click on, and Devs should be aware of this little issue as well, if they aren't already.",

I would also love more work on a chat system, especially for co-op. Most co-op games I join tend to kick me out before I can even help much. So I ran my own co-op game and people just do not join often. Seems like co-op is not a very successful implementation if you like playing with random people. \n\nOrder of things that unlock compared to quest needs is not aligned well. Current example, I need anesthetic and the cooking pot is not unlocked. It should unlock with that quest.\n\nIt is still fun to play, but could be SO much better. I will be curious to see how or if  it improves.",

Firstly, you can't name the houses and the controls for the controller are still a little difficult. Sometimes it gets stuck, etc. But nothing that reduces the fun of the game.\n\nps please increase the number of possible villagers. Unfortunately, the village bells are pointless because they are not inhabited or not all professions can be used.",

I can finally be stranded in feudal Japan and it is now one of my go to games. The most recent farming update does help with out the game plays. One of the few things I hope they do add is the ability to plant the various flowers (Iris, spider lily, daffodils, moon flower, etc.) you can find to beautify your villages or to use in recipes. I would also like to see Mushroom farming added. Even in lower graphics this game is beautiful. I also can not wait for the ability to choose a female character. \n\nA tutorial or better explanations on how to manage village productions and the happiness sliders would be helpful. ( I didn't realize they were sliders for almost 2 real life days.)\n\nI am eager to see how far this game goes.\n\n",

(right now i have to manualy press MAX on every worked after moral gets higher or if they get better tools..) it should be automaticly done..\n\n*(new homeless people close to my village should also be abel to see my village and come up to my village and ask if they can join,that would feel natural. like walk up/outside to the gate. ? \n\n*build a ship port were new people can arrive/trade. maby build your own ship and make it trade goods...\n\n*more quests\n\nHope the feedback helps.\n\nOverall a great game, support the developers and buy the game.!",

Once you reached a certain level of your village with self functioning status you just need to build the projects and wait for time to pass.\nGets kinda boring and I felt that something else is missing, more options to develop.\nIn addition, the lack of side quests are noticeable but I am sure we will see some soon.\nIf I had to recommend this game I would, even at this state BUT,  this game can be soooo much more...\nI just cant wait for it to grow and become better.\nAll I can say is huge thumbs up and keep up the good work.\nYou made my last 40 hours of game play on the computer, pure fun and enjoyable.\nLooking forward to what comes next.",

It at least needs a sandbox mode where you can just start making your village right away. \nAnd you can't attack other villages or anything, the whole game is just way too rigid and restrictive imo. Feels more like a job than a game.\n\n[u]Building[/u]\nThe building mechanics are way too un-userfriendly considering it's almost the entire focus of the game.\nIt's extremely picky about where you can place anything and it won't give you any further information for why you can't build in that spot. You'll spend an hour just trying to clear out a tiny area to build one small shack, only to eventually find out you placed it backwards. And then there's this issue where it leaves some buildings unfinished until you add a door or something, but then it doesn't list the doors in any of the menus that should have them. The whole thing is just insanely clumsy and disorganized.\n\n[u]User Interface[/u]\nThe UI is mostly fine but the way the building stuff is categorized needs to be way more intuitive, there's way too many things that require you to craft them. Alot of the stuff like lanterns and decorations should just be things you buy from traders or other villages. \nAnother small annoyance is bandit enemies being marked on the map with a giant symbol, feels very unimmersive. And personally i'd like for combat to be a bigger mechanic eventually.",

Also the ability to change NPC clothes would be nice. Clan battles would be cool to more shops and vendor options for your village would be nice some commerce to make it seem more alive and separate the village population right now my max population is 23 that's not 23/town that's a global maximum. It'd be nice if it was per town instead of a global max \nLastly a tab for auto save and a separate tab for manual save that save tab gets cluttered very fast \nUpdate adds a lot of good shit but they built a thieves fortress where i used to build my village and well theres no way to destroy the fortress.. guess ill find a new play to set up a village",

That and i hope im not the only one that requests true samurai armor in the future. Worth the buy any day of the week.",

In fact you will notice the bad reviews are exactly that \"ill wait until next year\" or \"don't buy it now\" etc etc. Look, its absolutely amazing. The potential is immense, at the time of this review I can confidently say you can see where its headed while trying it out now, there's plenty of satisfying game-play. Its supposed to be a grind and reward, the graphics are so amazing that just seeing what you build after taking time is super rewarding in itself not to mention the amazing mechanics and the way its organized. beats other world building survival games out of the water for me even if its not fully released yet. (I love history and gaming so if this is your personality buy it now)",

Can only get better from here, especially when automated farming is implemented. A few QOL improvements that I'd like to see implemented into these Dynasty games are things like infinitely expandable storage, minor teraforming tools for leveling uneven terrain, a freebuild system to build custom structures out of the available assets a'la Valheim, a way to permanently stop certain areas from re-spawning resources so you can build cool structures around the world map, more bandits, an invasion quest/mechanic, the ability to arm, train, and lead some bodyguards so you can take out larger bandit/invader encampments, some challenging boss battles, more end-game content, etc... As it stands, these games have very little replay value because the city-building aspect is often more tedious than its worth while lacking the ability to build in a creative way.",

Because most of your players are not going to be able to afford high performance gaming computers, I'd reconsider making it a high performance only game.\n\nWill change my review as time goes as this is early access!\nI'm really looking forward to maybe being able to actually play.",

Games that involve planning, gathering, building, problem solving, and survival simulation really appeal to me.

            "review": "Dec 2024: Trying the new update with combat and many other improvements. So much that is good! Just did the watchtower map flyover in a thunderstorm. Highly rec.\n\nLate Jan 2024: Tried again after some updates (?) and figuring things out and I totally recommend this game! Anyone who liked Medieval Dynasty will love this! (Light spoilers to follow.) More varied landscape than MD, different crops, killer good summer thunderstorms - really, the lightning is so cool! - and winter blizzards. It's more efficient to farm trees and build buildings than MD, one thing that did get tedious. There's a better storage system so less running back and forth to gather ingredients - probably the biggest improvement over MD for me. Also, interesting differences in technology for the different culture.\n\nSome things from MD aren't in (yet?): no domesticated animals, no adverse mechanics like getting cold, dirty, or drunk. My guy downed 8 sake and didn't feel a thing! There are a few typos (ginger can't be planted in spring, the tier 2 house sleeps 2 people, not 1) but that's small stuff. Overall, I think this will be a step up on MD and I can't wait to play the full game! \n\nI would give a positive review to the public if I was able to send separate review to the devs. I loved medieval dynasty and 100% I will love this one in time. But right now, after just a few slow hours, I can't proceed. I have buildings with \"empty\" walls, like the wood storage. I can't complete the building. The empty door frames stay green and nothing I do lets me finish them.  It's very confusing.\n\nWhat am I missing, devs?\n\nETA: after a few more tries and checking the threads, it's not just me. The game is bugged. Fix it plz devs. Such an excellent game I would love to carry on.\n\nLater: I started from scratch some few months after the above and the controls aren't doing what they are said to do. I \"head back to Ako\" equip hammer, and right click to call up the construction radial menu... there is no menu of any sort. WTF with this game?",

None of the solutions worked.\n\nI’ve tried:\nUpdating Windows.\nUpdating Drivers.\nVerifying integrity of Game files (They were all fine).\nLaunching outside of steam via the .exe file. \nRunning as administrator. \nRunning in Compatibility mode. \nManually setting the game to run using the GPU as opposed to letting Window’s decide.\nResynching the PC Clock\nEtc.\n\nNothing worked.\n\nI will probably keep this game to see if this eventually gets resolved with future updates, but right now I am unable to launch it.\n\nI am willing to update this review once I am actually able to play the game.",

Well sadly this is not that game but it does check all the vibe boxes in that department lol.\n\nTLDR:\nGreat game worth it.\n\n*UPDATE*\nSince the official Steam Deck update 3.5 this game is very stable with no issue and should be labaled as verified or at least playable.\n\n*NOTE* \nThis was on official Steam Deck OS and running on Proton Experimental using CryoUtilities mod at 16GB and swappingness set to 1. But since the OS update I don't think this matters.\n\nOn PC theres little to no issues or bugs, at least none I haven't encountered. The game in general is missing alot of key features that are not yet added into the game but is coming soon. In its current state it's really entertaining but still lackluster, there's not much combat just a few bandits but no samurai standoff, no last stand against a few warriors or bandits, no bounties to collect, no form to admit someone to their own failures and perform a seppuku, no way of interrogating bandits to tell you where their hideouts are (even though it doesn't exist). Nothing. But hey there's farming, hunting, crafting and building and micromanaging a village!\n \nBut given its in early access and missing features soon to come, this game is worth buying and sticking through the updates, especially since the developers are very active with the community.",

It's really great exploring and seeing the landscape. Hunting is equally easy and challenging making it fun. I'm looking forward to seeing it finished.\n\nA few things to mention that could be fixed or expanded on:\nWater- maybe adding a swimming animation. There are times you walk/ run into the water and you are almost completely submerged and it takes away from the realism that is already being accomplished.\n\nQuests- Sometimes it can be difficult to know what to do next or know how to accomplish it. An example is when you need to create a tanning vat in the tailor workshop. I explored all over and could not find any clay at all. I ended up buying it from a trader. It would have been nice to know how to get it or an area to look for.\n\nRain- The weather effects look great. Maybe if it rains the torches won't light and the camp fires go out unless there is overhead cover?\n\nMaybe expanding on some of the mechanics. Fires consuming wood constantly for example. Sometimes when hunting something a little ways away the animals tend to jerk. \n\nOverall, the game is playable and it is fun. I would recommend the game to someone currently.",

Early access is not the same as AAA beta access where you see the game at it's dress rehearsal shortly before the game goes live. The vast majority of early access games will not be polished with full content within a few months - realistically more like a few years. \n\nMost reviewers compare Sengoku Dynasty to Medieval Dynasty, some even call it a clone. I played Medieval Dynasty 5 times over the years and each was to some extent a different game. The first version of early access was actually a lot like Sengoku in the sense that (some of) the main story line was in place and the feel of the game was very RP/management. Over the years more content was of course added, but also the mechanics were altered. The result was rather game changing. As far as gameplay goes, Medieval Dynasty went from being heavy on lore and immersion to being (close to) hack n slash, and then back to a more balanced middle ground. Some I liked, some I didn't, but It's a work in progress and that's the deal with early access. \n\nNow we got Sengoku. It is not a clone of Medieval Dynasty in the sense that it's the exact same game just in a different setting and I for one am happy with that. Obviously it has a ton of mechanics in common with Medieval, but it is also it's own thing and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. It is of course quite limited still: \n\n- there are only a few perks which are filled out easily before you're even getting properly settled\n- very limited hostility from your surroundings (I suspect more hostile animals to be added later)\n- while farming is now implemented, not everything that can be grown is up front available, but enough to be useful\n- some materials do not seem to be available yet\n- a lot of conversations need updating (example: after 3 years you're still asking certain villagers where you are)\n\nThat said, if you play the game expecting a work in progress, you can be highly entertained. I know I am. It is beautiful, most of my village can actually be built even though I'm not very far in the story yet and enough of the story is in place to give at least a sense of where the game is going. Once I hit the wall, I expect to put the game away and forget about it for a few years, and then replay it as a whole new game (literally). Talk about replay-ability! ;)\n-",

Can't give it a 5 star but I'm sure it will develop more since it is early access,  would definitely love to have some kind of speech system with the npcs would make it a little better.  \n\nI do get a crash that happens often if I am in game trying to load a save file the game the game will freeze with no indication of loading.  Some times i can sit through it and the game will load up and other times im sitting for 5 mins or so waiting just to see it has crashed.  I do love the mechanics in the game but have seen some FPS issues especially with any models at a farther distance away.  Again these are some quality issues with the game but overall do love the play style and the building.  definitely good for killing and burning time.\n\n",

If you like ancient japan, city building, survival and some Rpg element. As well if you are patient with early access games.\nThen this game is for you!",

            "review": "Ok this is not easy to be fair. This game has already a lot of beauty, but beauty alone can't really make a game, that is for sure. About 60% of the game works fine and is also good balanced and well made. But there are a few issues you should know before you decide to buy it. \n\nI am working in my village and around it all day long just to get all resources the villagers need, because they use up plenty and most of them don't go working at all.\nThere are very few professions that seem to work. \nI can see that water collecting works, but the amount is rediculous. If I myself collect it I use up the buckets while the NPC seems to use them for a while mine are gone after one use. That should get fixed.\n\nThe hunter doesn't do anything it seems. His partner that should craft arrows and bows at his workbench doesn't work either. He tells me he got no armory. Why...I don't know, because each workplace has all possible storages and tools/weapons and workbenches. \nSame for the blacksmith and I assume he just needs a steel hammer that I could not produce yet, because I am not yet at Dynasty level 14.\nI finally found out that the armory is not just a little bag for weapons or the rack for arrows, it is a storage building that I did build now. Hopefully the hunter and his fellow arrow crafter will work now ;)\n\nIt takes doing quests and finishing building projects all over the map to level up your dynasty level and it seems to not matter how big the project is, how long it takes and how many workers are building it over how many seasons, you just go up one level each time, ...which should get changed.\n\nEach level up allows you to add one more villager to your village, but in the beginning you got to do a lot of quests before anyone to recrute shows up on the map, so you will be stuck with 2 people for a while.\n\nYou can get any steel tools only from traders that rarely ever have them, so I bought for example a steel pickaxe to get me some iron, but after 2 or 3 uses it broke already. Those tools should just last far longer, because there are only masterwork ones that are even better.\n\nThe firewood I cut down eats up a lot of time, because you really get far too few from a tree. By this and by the huge consuption of your people you are really busy to make sure you won't run out.\nThe wood cutters do work, but it is just not nearly enough for 10 people in your village, ...that should be changed. My lumberjacks do maybe half of the work to get the needed wood, the rest I got to do and unfortunately I can't add more people to their workplace.\n\nI had 9 stacks of 25 stone in my storage before the season changed and got 10 villagers, the next season 8 stacks where gone for maintenance. I am collecting the stone all the time just by picking it up on the way, but it gets really tidious and starts to be annoying by the amount they use up.\n\nWhile I use up sticks for cooking they don't seem to, so I got too many stick meanwhile. I wonder why sticks won't work as firewood too. Would solve some problems.\n\nIf you go out getting meat for your people the better option is indeed boars. The deers run away after one hit and if you throw a speer it might miss or just not be found any more. Each of those take a log and when you did hit the deer a second time it will go down. I don't think there are headshots or if so it is really hard to do one because they run already on quite some distance away if you get closer. The speers often disappear into the ground when the deer goes down, so it is better to go for boars, because you don't throw a speer at those, you hit them with your speer in your hands directly.\n\nBoars might feel hard, because they hit you twice or three times and you might be dead. \nYou'll loose money and equipment when dying, so better save the game before you try.\nIt is a bit tricky to kill them, but you can out manouvre those by running in circles and hitting them by running fast to them before they can charge. But to get the right distance to hit them is difficult in this case. They will have to recharge if you change position fast. That helps.\n\nFood gets cooked if you assign a cook to a fireplace in any house. One thing that really works.\nFood and grass spoils too fast. I drown in rotten stuff. I know it is needed for fertilizer later on, but even then it is just a mess. Straw doesn't spoil, but when I leave any on the drying rack when the season changes it is simply gone.\n\nOh and I almost forgot, the fisher does catch fishes and the net maker does his job too. But the fishes aren't many, just a very few.\n\nIt is early access after all and they are just getting an update done for farming. Might be helpful, because the game starts getting really exhausting for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the game, it is just really needed to fix some issues. I do believe the game is on a very good way to get nice and work better, but for now it is partly a mess or lets say just not working well enough. You got to live with that if you want to play it.\nI had fun while playing it for more than 60 hours, but meanwhile it is exhausting to do all work almost all alone while my villagers mostly hang out in nature enjoying the services I do. :P\nGaming should not get work!\n\nI tryed to give you a detailed impression how the game is till now, if it helped you please leave me a like, it cheers me up, thank you  :)",

The combat is lacking, the movements in water and land aren't the best but the biggest thing is that the resources don't re-spawn and there isn't much to do in the way of survival. The only good thing so far that I found is that the building in this game isn't that bad other then not being able to do anything to change the land. I have high hopes for this game, but with everything that isn't done or even done right even for an early access survival game. Overall its a wast of money for now in my opinion. At least until they do some major fixes to the game.",

Some patches of grass on the mountain are impassable (the fall damage is way too much sometimes).\nI'd like to know what the damage of each weapon is or how much my full set of Oni armor covers.\nMaybe make the resources that are blocking my structures visible, so I know what to remove to have my beautiful casita at the top of a mountain next to the sea (when I retire).\n\n\nPRETTY GOOD GAME WOULD RECCOMEND\n",

I see updates being made.\n\nThe Co-Op mode is counter-intuitive (so are some of the features, like the Dynasty job management and crafting/building system. But not as jarring), unless you know what to look for. Note for joining a private Co-Op game: You need to select co-op, check the private box and add the random generated password in the password box before pressing refresh to get it to work. Moreover, there's a lot of jankiness and lag when playing co-op.\n\nThere's also a lot of logic-defying problems for a \"survival\" game. But, I assume they will slowly implement that further down the line. By that, I mean stormy weather seems to just be a decoration. Frozen water doesn't kill. Etc. \n\nShould you buy the game now?

Will use this review to compare the 2 but the game itself is well worth the price and a bargain at any discount if you enjoy colony sims/survival exploration.\n\nPro's over Medieval:\n-Large work sites offer the ability to build bridges and other unique structures\n-Large map offers far more freedom of build locations\n-Fast travel to owned towns makes getting around easy\n-More items and a more invested build network between storage's makes for a slower but funner experience\n-COOP mode to allow you to play with friends (coming soon to Medieval)\n\nCon's over Medieval:\n-Not much farming implemented other then using foraging huts to gather the herbs/grass\n-No animals to buy and use as prison wardens for your inmates- i mean, villagers\n-Very limited skill tree, levelling up beyond dynasty level 5 is only for the building unlocks at set levels\n-Building solely reliant on dynasty level, making the mid-game just building special structures as there are no more quests\n\nTL;DR: Is probably going to be the best relaxed 3rd/1st person colony sim, depending on how well it shapes up over Medieval. Really fun to sink hours into and has COOP unlike many of these types of games.",

I did have some FPS issues, but the update that came out yesterday did help with that some. \n\nHowever, in general, I had a decent amount of fun with the game. There are a number of early game quests and story content along side the village building. The beginning of the game is fairly fleshed out and the devs are working on improving the known issues, such as the recent update that addressed inventory sorting and loading times. And there is currently enough content that can still keep you entertained for hours. \n\nI buy on a $1 / hr of content type deal, and currently it's giving close to my ratio. I speedran to the end to see what content was available, but if I took my time I could see it having ~30+ hrs of content if you take your time.",

Your villagers just stand around even if assigned to a job. You don't reap the rewards of their invisible efforts until the season changes. The stamina bar is an absolute JOKE. You can't even chop one tree down without running out of stamina. Then you still have to hit it two more times to make it into logs so FORGET about RUNNING around and farming logs. I found myself just standing around waiting for stamina more than I played. The \"skill\" tree isn't anywhere near ready for release. You only have four categories and 3-4 things in each to unlock so you find yourself sitting there with tons of skill points and nowhere to put them. Game just isn't ready. If it's on sale for maybe $10 I'd say it's worth it to try it and hang around to see what they do with it ... but $30 NO WAY. The game is beautiful and has a lot of potential. I hope they continue to make improvements ... but for now I just feel like I wasted my money.",

It's not for everybody at this stage. If you are early adopter and like to experiment, this game is for you. My speculation is the price will shoot to $80 when the game is ready for release.\n\nBuilding is nice and simple. It's not super realistic (which in my opinion is good because building your entire village realistically will take forever and will be boring). Buildings are huge! As you are building the village, it feels like an actual village, super real. All building have purpose, and they feel like building people would use back in a day. \n\nHunting, mining, and exploration feel real and supper fun! World map is huge and believable real. There are villages and monasteries that feel like people would use and live in back in a day.\n\nQuality of life updates are coming up! There are performance issues that hopefully get fixed soon.\n\nI am supper excited for this!",

This is clearly way to early to be releasing a public build of the game, unless they simply need the funding for development. \n\nI will revisit & re-evaluate it later down the road if/when it gets some major updates. Hopefully they keep at it and make something enjoyable. As of now it's way too early to be selling this, it's simply not worth the asking price even on sale.",

It's obvious that this isn't the first out the shoot for this development team - hardly any major gripes - haven't had but a couple small technical glitches - far less than would have been expected from a beta.\n\nRight now, the villagers / NPCs are kind of creepy weird in that if you walk into a room, they walk away from you and they kind of don't know what to do with themselves. I know from the dev updates that they are aware and are working on villager interaction and how they act but just know it's kind of weird right now.\n\nYou will be able to tell that the crafting and achievements are being worked on - there's quite a bit of depth for an early release but you'll find it slow and challenging to get to 21 - the only real advancement possibility right now is through special project completion so while you're waiting for seasons to complete, it gets a bit slow but I spend that time hoarding resources and building out my empires. \n\nHunting is a bit wonky right now too. It's the same methods, regardless of if you're hunting an animal or a bandit - it's almost too easy - with the exception of the aggressive species (pigs - they are literal jerks in the game :)) and when you encounter more than 1 bandit. Bandits bug sometimes though and they just stand there while you pelt them with arrows. It's difficult to balance out resources of fur against the volume you need for leather to make more advanced tools and weaponry - especially when you have so many of your villagers tied up for seasons at a time, completing special projects.\n\nThe elements of customizing houses, furniture, having a spouse, etc. are all in obvious development - they just aren't features yet but you can see the concepts being built in with each release.\n\nThere's not a bunch of intriguing story elements - I'm not sure if that's by design or if it's still in development but the slave story line for one of the cities, is frustrating because - well, I don't want to give any spoilers but I'm guessing you'll agree. \n\nLastly, it's clear that a lot of development is underway for ease of use storage, sorting, etc. that make it a bit time consuming while they work toward each release but it's still worthy of a download and play.\n\nAt time of posting, I've played for 323 hours taking my time - I haven't dug into the coop play yet but will update this review once I do.",

You wont get another bell \"ever\" and you cant progress with anything more but wander around wondering why you cant do anything. Just to be reset to the beginning as the season change. But guess what?...... You will not be given a bell ever again! Open free will would be nice..... I feel forced through this game in a predetermined path. I would like to go off and do what I want, when I want. I have a feeling that as I play more, I will come across more brick walls if I'm not careful.

I've played survival before but never any of the \"dynasty\" games like other reviewers. The game is ROUGH and I've had some memory related errors (memory leaks perhaps?) but overall it's a very compelling game for those who wish to kill a lot of time running around the woods increasing your villages. \n\nFor me the biggest downsides, outside of the performance issues (crashes/freezes) I'd say is that I don't feel like the game  gives you a lot of info on what options you have available to you. It took me 20 hours just to figure out that at a certain point there's \"refugees\" you can randomly find to recruit to your villages and expand your business. I also found a lot of the UI to be really tedious in being able to craft what I wanted to when I wanted to. It is frustrating to not know exactly how long it'll take to finish the \"special products\". Running everywhere is also a bit annoying and I'd appreciate some horses or fast travel or something.\n\nBut overall the game has a wild charm and despite the fact I have so many other things to do, like plan a real trip to Japan myself, the game draws me back to playing it constantly. When this is fleshed out, optimized, and fully completed this game is going to take my life away.",

Confusing progress, levels without a reason, no dynasty (family) features, no farming, combat is simplistic, no terraforming (how are we going to do rice paddies and irrigation???), finite resources (no tree respawn, or ability to plant them), underwater walking + no water mechanics yet, etc.\n\nNow, Medieval Dynasty was a great little game, and really excited to see co-op coming to it after it was apparently developed as a feature for Sengoku, so with shared features, this game has quite a bit of potential, and I hope that the developers continue to add features to both games.  (and with their pirate one in the works, ships and swimming!)\n\nBut if you are looking for something that is playable, makes sense, and has cohesive flow, you may want to wait a little on this title.  \n\nWill update this as things improve.",

Optimization is better--not great, but playable if you don't crank the graphics settings too high.  It has some quests.  Unlike may similar games you have to do the quests to unlock technologies.  Which actually makes sense.  To learn how to build a smithy, you have to find a blacksmith and convince him to teach you.  That sort of thing.  \n\nIt's still very much EA, but it's at the turning point that as long as the devs don't abandon work, it should be a really good game. \n\n\n-----------\n\nThis game does have a lot of promise and with some work I think it can be really enjoyable, but MAN does it need a lot of optimizations and improvements to make it playable.",

I thought it would be just a reskin of Medieval Dynasty its NOT.\nEveryone probably got this game because of Medieval Dynasty, which is an awesome game. \nYou think \" hey maybe its like medieval dynasty IN JAPAN\" but short answer is :\nNO its a different game. Here's why IMO\n1. For starters There is NO FARMING - Yet\n2. Graphics are still not optimized - MD was too at start, so lets hope for the best\n3. Trees DON't Grow Back - I left the stumps in place and surprise it stays that way forever\n",

Plus there are many 'ergonomic' issues with the UI, and the way that the co-op was implemented, for example joining dialogues. Game also feels pretty clunky. Overall, I think that it would be better to play alone for now, but I play games almost exclusively online with friends so that's a no no if my friend is constantly telling me how bad his experience is.",

I was very excited about this game, but I eventually held out on this game, due to the reviews. Now it was on sale and a lot of patches have seem to come out rapidly and so far, I haven't run into any problems! I run it on high settings and besides the first loading screen taking 2 minutes, everything runs fine once in the game. I have a game PC with a Radeon RX 6700 XT. I was very excited for a game made in Unreal Engine 5 and it looks stunning, I wish i myself could take a dive into the water. I'm excited to explore this game more and to see where it will be a year from now. I'm looking forward to farming veggies in the future. I like how the villagers and workers UI looks, better than Medieval Dynasty IMHO. I might update my review later when I have more playtime, but so far it's great!",

Especially if you dig the Japanese era style buildings, lifestyle, cast system, and terrain.  So far I am enjoying this game 5 out of 5 stars!!!  \n\nSome dislikes, not leaving much detail, going to let those who decide to play figure it out and form their own opinions, however, I wish the skill system and skills in general were better/more thought out or just more of them.  And maybe I'm just not far enough yet but I have 5 skill points to spend in one skill tree and at least 1 if not 2 or 3 other skill points in the other trees (except one).  So I have no way to develop my character yet.  But I'm assuming it's coming.  I wish the seasons were longer ( 3 day minimum, 5 or even 7 day max before it auto switches season).  And finally, after a few hours of play, and what I would've thought was a good amount of development, I still only have 3 people in my village-- I wish there were more NPCs available to obtain, and that these  NPCs had speacializations on what they were good at doing so when picking who would fill you last bed, it would mean more if you need a cook to get a cook or if you need a craftsman or tree cutter(aka a big strong worker) there was someone you could invite to join the village that was good at crafting or tailoring or woodworking(lumberjack) etc.\n\nBut all in all, 5 out of 5 for me so far!

However once it launched I dove right in I never got into Mideval Dynasty much I think i was fixed on League and other games. However when this game dropped I played it all weekend and even before the 1st patch I had 50 hours. I decided to take a break since my 1st file as no longer valid somewhat due to changes and I went back to try Mideval Dynasty. If this game delivers something similar to that I'll be hooked I really enjoyed building and it felt more simple however I bet that will change. Great game to chill and play and just enjoy. It's a beautiful world the music and sounds are amazing hope the enhance the storms a bit.",

            "language": "english",
            "review": "Good afternoon, I wanted to congratulate you because it is an entertaining game to be tested. I would like to give you some observations about the game that I have experienced and tips that would make the game more realistic and entertaining.\n1 - To be able to level the land of your village, being able to create roads where there are none to generate \"streets\" in your town. At the same time, you can use a tool, which could also be a shovel to eliminate the branches and roots that exist wildly in your town and thus be able to have everything clear and more aesthetic.\n2 - With the shovel you can dig a hole in the ground and place tree seeds to give a more beautiful touch to your village, so that after the seasons it can grow little by little. Creating something like green areas in the town. (This could also help replant the forests you cut down around and near your village.)\n3 - That there are more animals and that they can appear depending on the season of the year. For example: if it is Spring, hares-foxes-deer-birds-butterflies... or maybe a hive of bees from which you can get honey (with a special suit and if you don't wear it it will take your life, because otherwise the system of creating clothes in the tailor are not used for anything). In Summer and Autumn the same animals could be kept, although in Autumn ducks, squirrels, other types of birds, badgers, bears that look for honey or other food for hibernation could be incorporated... and finally in Winter hostile animals could appear (such as wolves , foxes, bears, etc.) that look for food and can attack your village or a neighboring village (If the neighboring village itself has security soldiers, it can defend itself against these animals and if they are injured you can offer them medicine) (creating a mission of rescue the neighboring village and thus gain levels of the 'way of the warrior' and 'fame with the village' that help you trade or teach you 'skills' to unlock the skill tree or the building and furniture construction wheel)\n4 - That bears, foxes, wolves and other animals have shelters/homes like caves or burrows and that you can get close to them. And that these animals are more hostile because they are carnivores, both towards you... and because they are going to eat perched birds, hares or deer among the forests.\n5 - That there is a system of temperatures and diseases, which makes the gameplay difficult by having to worry about creating medicines and clothing for your town inhabitants or for you or for a neighboring village (which as a mission) sends you to your town somewhere NPC asking you for medicine/clothes/help. In this way, the main character can feel cold or hot depending on whether it is Summer or Winter and so you use clothes depending on whether it will work better in cold or heat. Or you may feel wet because it is raining and that makes you have to wear the 'Straw Coat' or 'higher sandals' or 'leather shoes'. It is understood? Because otherwise the clothing creation system in the tailor is not used at all And of course, obviously you can dress your villagers with other clothes or have them do it themselves as winter or spring approaches or it rains and that the life of your character and your villagers go down progressively slowly. (The same if you don't have enough firewood, logs, wood in general to get through the winter, or food)\n6 - That the birds do not continue flying over the sky when it is raining, I see that as a failure... the birds do not fly when it is raining. And so in this way you could incorporate nests in the trees, to give more realism or holes in the trunks for squirrels.\n7 - Being able to cultivate on the ground with the help of a shovel and a hoe, to create a crop of berries or potatoes or cereal or rice for example. Let the crop grow progressively and if winter comes and you did not harvest the crop on time; May your crop die. And if you do collect the crops that give you food x2, if you plant 1 potatoes that gives you 2 or 3 potatoes. And to get \"berry or potato seeds\" you have to lose 1 food x 1 seed.\n8 - That in the tailor's station the clothes are not only decorative, as I said before, that they give you more protection against damage or against the cold or against the rain or against the mud and thus you are forced to bathe in a spa that exists and you have to pay 10 coins. In this way you would encourage us to trade to get money because when we bathe in the spa we can: A) Wash off the dirt B) get an increase in strength or that the disease decreases a little or that increases our life a little (all this in a temporary only)\n9 - Add to the creation tools 'fishing rods'. That there are 2 types, for example: 1) of wood that deteriorates and breaks immediately when used, for example, 5 times. And 2) made of iron and breaks when used 25 times. In this way you would add the ability that in the 'fishing station' you can catch other fish only with 'fishing rods'. (And that there may be a mission in some coastal village to catch 20 fish = 10 of each type)\n10 - That there are more neighboring villages such as the 'coastal village' and that this one \"teaches you how to fish\" an NPC, and give you a map with 'where the different types of fish are found'\n11 - I would give different merchants, 1 from each village, a Spring-Summer map that tells you where animals are found in X areas near THAT VILLAGE and another map exactly the same but from Autumn-Winter. And you have to go through the different towns/villages on the map to trade with the merchants and buy these maps from each of them. (This is how you encourage the player to trade)\n12 - That the map is marked with an icon where there are rivers, waterfalls and lakes that you have discovered. That the different bridges, watchtowers and other areas of 'special projects' also be indicated.\n13 - That there are other special projects that are a little more difficult; such as building a chiseled/normal stone wall around a village, creating a merchant camp where only merchants reside at a specific point on the map or creating a water mill near a village's river...Etc. All of these could be missions that would give life to the game, and they could be sent to you by the village chiefs and thus gain your trust. Or you could be asked for these quests by villagers in a town in exchange for money or items or food.\n14 - In the construction of your village you could incorporate high log walls and have small watchtowers near these walls, in this way you can add villagers to the protection of the village (giving them uniforms and weapons, and these villagers patrol at night while others are sleeping or eating dinner in their homes) \n15 - Improve the reality of movements in the villages, so that it is seen that during the day the NPCs work and wipe \"the sweat from their brows\" or sit in the benches that you build or that drag buckets or bags with food or cut down a tree or drag logs to their respective warehouses. And during the night they limit themselves to sleeping and having dinner/eating around the fire at home. They could also \"talk\" (generate noise without the need for dialogue, or you could implement them later, but simple) among themselves and get along well or badly, and if they get along well they can form a family in which they have children and the elders they die. (In this way the construction of an altar and a cemetery would be \"necessary\", because otherwise these constructions are not carried out since they have \"no real function\".)\nI really like your game, it has a lot of potential. Both the game and you. I've played a lot and that's why so many interesting things have occurred to me. I hope that nothing offended you, and that if you liked any ideas you can implement them in the final game. All of these things don't have to be \"all free\" you could ask for some money for expansions or DLC's. Hahaha well I just wish you good luck, lots of encouragement and keep it up. THANK YOU!!!",

I finished the early access game play at about 81 hours and had a pretty good time throughout it all.\nI will say I have never played Medieval Dynasty which seems to be the reason behind most of the bad reviews, I went into it thinking I was going to play an early access survival/village builder and that is what I got out of it. I'm curious to see how closely they follow the roadmap they released.\nI think if I bought the guide I would have been less confused at the beginning but I enjoyed trying to figure out how to do things and if I got stumped I just went to the discussions and normally someone had already asked the question I had.\nAfter the second update I restarted and really had a good time picking new village locations along with playing with the knowledge I picked up on my first start and without some of the early bugs they fixed. \nI never played multiplayer so I can't say how that was but here are a couple of things I am looking forward to as they keep working on the game: \n~Adding a pause feature\n~Moving along the roadmap to add farming and a new village\n~Allowing interactions with the map (zooming and custom markers)\nAnd hopefully the full release at some point with family building, more quest, etc.\n",

            "review": "After long consideration, I've decided to pen a positive review for \"Sengoku Dynasty\", a game that undeniably has its fair share of issues. Yet, despite its imperfections, there's something strangely compelling about this game.\n\nTLDR: Pure early access experience. Skip if you prefer finished products (or, atleast, developed further than 0.1.x. version) over works-in-progress. Good style and shows promise though.\n\nCons:\n\nUser Interface: The game's UI, including its barely readable map and lack of clear information on construction durations and etc, feels rather crude and basic. This often makes navigation and planning a challenge.\n\nCombat Mechanics: The battle system is bonkers. Both spear and sword hitboxes feel messy, making combat encounters more a game of chance than skill.\n\nVillager AI and Placement: A sore point for many players. Villagers can be found idling endlessly where they were recruited or aimlessly wandering around. Some NPCs also seem to permanently occupy your village without offering any real interaction or benefits.\n\nProgression Issues: The game's recipies system feels odd. Some fundamental recipes and tools are locked away until higher levels, which can hamper the early-game experience.\n\nLong Progression: Leveling your dynasty, especially in solo gameplay, is a grind. Projects like watchtowers and bridges consume time, resources, and endless running back and forth.\n\nResource System: The distribution and consumption of resources (by the villagers) feel random at times. Having different storage types and moving materials to your inventory for nearby builds feels overly unnecessarily tedious in this game. \n\nRunning Simulator: The lack of fast travel, combined with the challenge of navigating certain areas, often reduces the game to a running simulator. While some workarounds exist, they aren't intuitive.\n\nTechnical Issues: The game suffers from some wonky physics, clipping issues, and long loading times. These aspects, unfortunately, pull the player out of immersion frequently.\n\nDespite its laundry list of issues, there's a reason I'm leaning towards a positive review. The world of \"Sengoku Dynasty\" offers an atmospheric and deeply engrossing setting. The game's lore, the intricacies of the dynasty system, and the sheer unpredictability that comes from its flawed mechanics create an experience that's oddly captivating. Honestly, I am willing to blame publisher for the most issues, because game sure needs a lot of work but has a lot of potential in terms of immersion, mechanics, style. \n",

            "review": "As someone who loved Med Dynasty, with my only thought being \"I wish this had some form of Coop.\", Sengoku Dynasty is a great game.\n\nThere are certainly downsides. The game is a little bare-bones at the moment and some of the gameplay can feel lackluster at times. But for me, it's a reminder of where Medieval Dynasty was at when it launched. So based on the development of that game, I expect great things from this one.\n\nWhilst I do reccomend this game for fans of medieval dynasty, if you are new to the dynasty games and not too worried about the setting, I would suggest getting medieval first. It is also about get a big update with Coop and a new map, it's more fleshed out and in my opinion has more longevity than this game currently has. But that said, I do expect this game to be as good as med in the near future.",

From a city building perspective, the game can be pretty entertaining, there are tons of building options and ways to upgrade your city. Now, from a mechanics/ game-play point of view, this game still needs tons of work. The hunting is ridiculously hard, combat mechanics are mediocre, and the basic animations are still super janky. \n\nI really hope the developers take the time to polish some of these things and find ways to make the environment/ world more immersive.

Your villagers are troglodytes unable to do anything (even dress up) and except doing seasonal work, which as of now is bugged and very bare they will just roam around semlessly, actually some of them will be all over the map andyou won t have the nice thriving village feeling you d expect from this game (feature coming soon). \n\nStill this game is fairly priced for its current phase and promising, but know that after dinasty 7 theres no content (except if you really want that steel katana that you can't use on anyone as there are no enemies apart the bandits). \n\nI look forward to the next updates.",

I finally said \"enough is enough, no more mr. nice guy\" and stole some fish soup from that one dude by the beach....10/10...will fight obnoxious wild boar again. \n\n*will update story after learning how to craft spears *\n\n\n12/02/2024 update*\n\nDear diary, \nIt is day 211 since I begin my journey to become the greatest warlord in the region. Today, I fought off two looter camps with my lousy co-op little brother who only main the bow in this game. It was indeed a very gruesome battle, but in the end, those 50 brewing potions, 3 wooden ax, 5 wooden spears didn't go to waste. Indeed, many sacrifice was necessary today but we won the war. On the bright side, we had looted many goods back to our small village by the beach. \n\nSoon, my brother and I arrived at our village. I was greeted by my soon marriageable wife npc Otaku. She was very happy when I gave her some looted seashells. I hope we will get marry soon and be blessed with a child from the kami. \n\nHowever, my happiness didn't last long, one of my guard had spotted some dark smoke near the mountain region. What I fear the most had come. A razing enemy party is approaching. From the corner of my eye, I knew the enviable enemy want their revenge. My village's freedom is now in jeopardize, it is either be killed or kill. I grab my bronze samurai sword and await the enemy's movement at dawn. If I don't make it back, I leave this diary to my son, Koku.",

Currently I have my save past Dynasty level 14 after grinding and doing the same repetitive things, figured the quest would have me do something else, but nope it just tells me to grind to level 21.  There is a bunch of things that are still locked such as the tavern and other production buildings and with those being locked its the same thing.  Also once you get above 20 people in one village its a grind to keep them happy, I feel like I'm doing more just to keep them happy when they should be self sufficient at this point.  \n\nAt the end of the day, I do recommend the game and look forward to the finished product however I feel that this was released far to early to be an actual finished product for the price point.",

There was so much potential starting, but it just kinda dies... when you have to do the same thing for 14 fucking hours to get to the next step. The game is early access, but devs not launching their games now-a-days is pretty much the standard. Long and short, I fast forward to get the game going but the whole time I have to have my workers on the special projects, but the are pissed because they have no food, because there are no workers due to special projects. So the entire time I'm playing, the workers are standing around beating off, because the only thing to do is to push special projects that all gets done when you skip to the next season. It's a game of busy work, and I'm not about that life. Oh and the discord fucked.  Maybe one day, but for now, I do not recommend anyone picking this game up.",

The lack of fast travel points between your other villages and NPC settlements means that most of your game time is walking , I wonder if the devs took inspiration from Death Stranding . Another issue I have is the npc's that  give you the opening quests , don't become part of your settlement. Unless I'm missing something which is a possibility. The game is a good time sink , also it's right up the alley for players of previous resource/survival/building/city management games like Conan Exiles and the a fore mentioned Medieval Dynasty. A bit pricey for the amount of content you have now, but, inflation is inflation and people need their money. \n\n",

Already has enough content to be playable, and worth the price , in my opinion.\n\nFor those NOT familiar with Medieval Dynasty these are first person, build settlement, games (think game with a Fallout 4 settlement focus). Including a fairly big world, farming, basic resource gathering, hunting, managing villagers and doing quests. Some combat but fairly serene and peaceful. Only run into angry pigs and bandits, so far. I expect to see bears and wolves, since that is in the other game. Who knows what's to come in the future. Has day, season and year cycles. Beautiful scenery. Multiplayer is working. Inviting is a bit awkward. Hopefully it will be made easier.\n\nDislikes... No character customization, yet. First person, so not a huge deal but with multiplayer it becomes more of an annoyance and shortcoming. You, and everyone who joins your game, is stuck playing some dude. I'm hoping this is something they will add to. There are plans to add female characters and starting classes. I'm hoping for more. Like short, tall, thin, fat, hair cuts...\n\nThe game developer has made great progress on Medieval Dynasty, which has been a playable game with constantly new additions and hours and days worth of game play. So unless they run into big money problems this should not turn into useless ABANDONWARE, like some early access games.",

Even if you build buildings by farming a tree and it will write +1200 anyway, the tree disappears from the storage, I don’t understand why and how and why!!!                                                                                                                                                            Stone at first Ok But then it will go to maintain the village and when you have 30+ people you will need 10 buildings to farm stone because the village consumes 3k and each building will give 350 also need to build + interior and clay which will give 5 support is impossible put on the farm only a stone which will give only 2 Total from 30 population you have 10 current engaged in support, not to mention other tasks                                                                                                                            Straw is also a pain in the beginning, you will need to collect a lot with your hands since the sickle cannot be crafted, but only bought from monks at the end of the world                                                                                                                                       To build an ice storage facility, you NEED ICE, but it’s impossible to farm ice, you can only buy it, but the merchants don’t have it, you need to skip the season and then with 1% it appeared, it will be when I don’t know when I bought 6 but I need 10                                                                                                                                                                                                    Also, in order to buy something to trade, you will need to run around the map like a horse no fast travel no horses nothing \nfarm too much farm                                                                                                                                                                   +animals bug fly teleport the same bandits                                                                                                                                   Oh Yes Pain #2 Watchtower Bridge Buildings it takes from 1-2 seasons to 8 seasons what kind of nonsense I waited 8 seasons for the construction to be completed                                                                                                                            The health of the settlers is the same as the maintenance of the village needs 1000000000 buildings to support also with water also 1000000 wells                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Security, you need to craft 50 peaks for defense every season, they use them at a time Well, of course you need one log for the peak aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 1 Log for the peak Seriously,  developers are serious!! <<<<<<<                                                   \nWell, the end killed me and made me write this review                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n  After 45 hours of farming waiting for the bridge to be built, also for pain and bugs, I went to set up a quest for the 21st level of the dynasty                                                                                                                                                                              i approached the monk 4 times yes yes 4 times give the quest and he writes me thanks for the game in early access and then the conversation menu freezes and writes that it’s impossible to go any further what the fuck it’s all just thanks Bitch it killed me In the game there are no farms there is no progress longer Dynasty level 14 Why did I wait ah? game for 15 hours and then 14 hours you will farm why add 21 dynasties at all if there is no further progress to infuriate the players, well, here they have 10/10",

I can tell that the Devs are both knowledgeable and respectful of Japanese culture. So far, I am wrapped up in the story...\n\nThere are no Early Access game unplayable bugs. Feels like it simply needs some quality of life polishing, as is to be expected. At the time of writing this, the game has been live for only 17 days. My brother and I were able to play for about 8 hours straight with zero issues.",

Not a lot of content to see as of yet, but hopefully they have a lot more planned for the future!\nMap needs some help - the lack of any interaction is a drag. \nSkill trees are largely absent.\nBasically, if you're looking for a complete game this isn't it. Wait awhile before purchase. If you're fine with early access and coping with some movement bugs/poor optimization then go ahead and give it a spin.",

SO many issues - fundamentally broken with fabricated roadblocks just to drag the experience along.  \n\nUI is one of the worst I've ever dealt with.  Not intuitive and very clunky making it a chore to manage towns with 15+ refugees.\n\nAI job working is flat out broken.  Workers were assigned, had tools / items required, and never achieved any output.  \n\nHonestly what makes this game different is also its bane.  The seasonal progression does not work as is.  You don't seem to accumulate any worker resources until you've switched seasons.  So once you realize the AI is borked and they're not providing any resources you're in a pickle having wasted a entire season for nothing.\n\nInventory management is terrible, you can't sort or filter anything in the UI (inventory or otherwise), there's no rhyme or reason how jobs are listed in the Dynasty which leaves you to hunt.  If you're in the job view and try to assign a worker there's no indication if that person already has a job or not - making this view useless and forcing you to instead use the population view instead and having to hunt for the correct job.  This frustration is amplified when you start running into special construction projects that can accommodate up to 6 workers.  Instead of it showing as one job allowing 6 workers - its shown as 6 separate jobs.\n\nAll of these things literally make the game a hassle to play!  Games shouldn't be a hassle to play.\n\nHonestly one of the most frustrating survival games I've ever played.  I am legit pissed off having paid 30 bucks for this trash.",

I hate to run on the other side of map just because I'm missing one item that I forgot to buy. I don't have that much time. A Horse or fast travel would improve game play.\n- This one is huge but having a japanesee Voiceover would increase immersion. Nowadays it can be done using AI, cheaply and efficiently. Even this would be better than the text. \n- Building upgrades (upgrade the building to host more people or expand production.\n",

            "review": "It's not ready yet, not even for early access I would say. Maybe because they're using Unreal Engine 5 instead of 4 over Medieval Dynasty, but a lot of niceties have been lost, and it doesn't feel good to move around or to look around. \n\nIf you run straight forward and turn 90 degrees, the player has to arc around, so doesn't feel responsive at all.\nThe camera is following the player's head way too much, the constant bobbing when doing any activity just gives me a headache, i much prefer the 1st person style Medieval Dynasty had. 1st Person in this still doesn't feel good, looking down for example is following the head from 3rd person view, so you don't look straight down properly.\nSome of the lost smaller niceties include crafting many items; before you could use the keyboard alone to craft all, now you have to use the mouse to select a quantity. You can't hold E to pick up multiple items in a row (like grass), you have to press-hold E for every item. The in-game menus use bright parchment paper so it's hard to read some texts, especially when it's white text over parchment paper. Building buildings don't use clear-blue areas like in Medieval Dynasty, so it's hard to see through, and the extra walls that you could build were confusing at first; you still have to 'build' the walls that don't exist. Looking at food in the item menu, I couldn't really tell how much food it recovers, or what numbers my hp or food were at. If a tutorial comes up while you're hammering or anything, the player keeps going behind the tutorial.\n\nI do like what the story is potentially becoming over Medieval Dynasty's jokey story, and the setting and visuals are appealing, maybe a bit too bright at times. Not sure about going straight into building a village and dynasty and managing people, I'd prefer having an existing village to visit first like in Medieval Dynasty, and having a chance to do some quests to get a feel for the game before getting to the dynasty. Multiplayer is a nice addition, something I wanted while I was playing Medieval Dynasty, and I wanted to try out this game's multiplayer as well, but like my review, I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current state, and wouldn't recommend it to my friends now to try out the multiplayer. I do hope it grows and gets better, I really want it to be good",

I was so excited, I didn't know what to say.\nBut we still have to talk about the parts that should be improved, so that the game will change.\n\nI would like to ask the author: I have some ideas. Will you make a system like Mount and Blade 2 in the future? Or something like Nobunaga's Ambition・Creation Sengoku Lishiden?\n\nBecause many people are expecting that the prestige of the protagonist will reach a certain level. The Japanese shogunate or the emperor will authorize official positions. After all, it is a Warring States period, which has a certain appeal (official system).\n\nWill there be a new building? If certain conditions are met, there will be famous warriors coming to visit.\nIt can also improve the content of the game.\n\nMy thoughts are basically biased towards Japanese historical movie scenes.\n\nLet’s stop here for now, first observe your direction and then do analysis.",

A basic questline, some hints for some game mechanics that are not yet fully implemented. Some bugs that I have not discovered yet but one. \n\nI think it's great that first came the details for the environment and now they can build on that! So many games have lot of content but look lige a child's drawing. Not here! There has been a lot of research that there can be a lot of realism!\n\nWhat I can get from this game or simulation is a very relaxing experience. If helps slowing me down after a stressful daytime.

But after reaching Dynasty 9, the game somewhat feel dull and tiring. \n\nFirstly, trying to expand the number of villagers is done by exploring the world and hope that instead of a trader spawning in, you could find a refugee staying at a campsite. (I've only found my 1st random refugee after 12 hours of exploring not including the 2 given at the start).\n\nSecond, there are only 2 main village and a castle in the whole map that are spread out so trying to explore and talk to the traders at each town is taking some time. Hopefully a donkey or horse would be added in the future to help with the ease of moving around the map.\n\nHopefully by the end of their Early Access, there would be more Quality of Life features and skills that hopefully work(?). The current skills with the axes chopping trees faster doesn't seem to feel different between the basic and iron axe.",

I find myself often sitting on houses roof tops just waiting to see every day's sun rise and sun set lols. \n\nIs it lacking features / a bit clunky / has a variety of bugs at this stage ? YES, sure!\nThat is the definition of an early access game though so if you are not willing to get in on it this early, wait and see how the development progresses over the next months.\n\nAnd as a big plus, 4 players co-op play is already implemented and working great.\nIt is a blast to play with freinds even at this early stage.\n\nI have full confidence in the dev team working on it (SuperKami). They have been quick to release bugfixes and QoL updates, have clearly showed the road map and what they plan to add to the game over the few coming months and are fully open to players feedback.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have a debt to settle with a gang of boars, my villagers will have bacon for dinner today ;)",

You have some basic gameplay which can get you entertained a couple of hours. \n\nPros:\n- it looks nice\n- the vibe is kinda good\n- they have a story line new, not perfect, but something.\n- it is a good foundation for the rest of the game. With updates it can become a very cool game.\n\nCons:\n- even basic objects are not in the game yet.\n- no voice over\n- alot of unavaible content\n- it runs like shit\n- loading takes forever\n\nFor me it is kinda weird that they implemented alot of things that they fixed in medieval dynasty already. I know it is a different company but still. If it is based on medieval dynasty why do we need to wait for things already build on that game. Just use medieval dynasty as a base game and change it somewhat. That would have solved alot of problems we have right now.",

I noticed the NPC's appear to glide rather than walk when at a distance and are somewhat jerky.  I have seen the game crash several times with what appear to be driver issues. \n\nThere are a few game play issues that I hope are updated.  Given the number of logs required to get started it would be a bit more helpful to get a bit more from the trees.  I am not far enough into the game yet to know if it becomes even more of an issue with other projects in the game.\n\n Overall, I am enjoying the game and look forward to the improvements to handle the issues.",

Decor the houses, the town and have fun with it. As of right now, not much as combat goes but u see the place holders. Right now all towns share storage witch makes managing 4 town easier but a lot of work having to reset the projects and reassign jobs every season. Each town has a limit of 30 people, max 50 building total, so you should split up your towns, 1 mining, 1 wood, 1 hunting, 1 food, and then some side jobs that go in them 4, you can put a storage container in the crafting station that can pull from the shared storage.",

I've enjoyed many hours exploring, questing, building, hunting, and collecting.  The premise of shipwrecked refugees gives the game a noble ambition, something missing in many other games that make personal ambition the feature.  The music, the dress, the plants all match the period and locale.  Devs are working steadily to fine tune and have plans to expand the lands and character pathways.   I'm a little amazed at the negative reviews.   Whiners and trolls I suppose.  Not to say there aren't areas to improve.  But those will be dealt with.  The price is about right in my mind.  Maybe a bit high for the game in its current state, but over time the value will come for the investment.  Looking forward to see how it shapes up.",

Calling the Game \"Early Access\" (not finished) is an understatement.\nWhile i do see a lot of potential in this game, right now it's just not fun.\nThe Game's Controls are incredibly sluggish and performance leaves much to be desired (I've got a 3060ti, so i'd expect a smooth experience). \nThe Hud and UI Elements are quite ugly and here too the controls aren't very fluid and fun to use.\nThe Progressing of building and gathering materials is really tedious.\n\nOverall, right now: I dont recommend anyone buying this game expecting something like Medieval Dynasty.\nWhile the overall idea is the same, the implementation is 3/10.\nI hope this game is gonna get the same amount of love by the developers as MD did and may sometime in the future become just as fun.",

However, if you've already played Medieval Dynasty and looking for something similar, then I do no recommend this game at this stage.\n\nEdit: If you're looking for something like Medieval Dynasty but want to play with a friend and just build a village, then I would recommend this game. I truly believe you could have 20+ hour enjoyment alone just building and exploring.\n\nDid I enjoy the 10 hours that I played solo? \n\nShort answer.\nYes. I like building a village and the game offers that.\n\nLong answer.\nBy playing this game at this early stage I can see the potential. I excuse all the bugs, the clunky/bad mechanics, the terrible AI, the lack of proper quests etc. I open myself up to disappointment by thinking what the game can become and what I expect the game will become once it's done and released. I might even add that I'm a little scared that they won't put as much effort into making this the god tier game that I think it has the potential to be, but rather focus on future projects. Which seems to be the way this studio likes to run things.\n\n I'll revisit this game in a year or two and if they work on the things that I hope they will, my review will change.",

            "review": "TL;DR: It's Medieval Dynasty in Asian setting with more focus on convenience and less on annoying hyper-realism. It's relaxing, fun to play, a bit repetitive but never boring. Patches come regularly and there are no crashes or game-breaking bugs so far. 8/10 if you like slow-paced resource gathering, building managment and a few casual elements of survival.\n\n\nIf you already know Medieval Dynasty, you will recognize the basic mechanics very early. It's the same principle, but with a different setting and a few varying details.\n\nIn my opinion, Sengfoku focusses a little bit more on convenience than on absolute realism, which in my book makes Sengoku Dynasty a lot more fun to play than Medieval Dynasty, even in this very early form. For example, inventory weight does not influence walking speed so you can carry a lot more without having to walk super slow. There is also no thirst, just hunger. Food also stays edible longer, etc.\n\nThe graphics are nice, not great, but good enough to let you appreciate the idyllic nature around you. Only the walking animation seems still  a bit weird, but in my opinion, the game looks pretty decent and most importantly: it doesn't feel empty.\n\nThere is no audio in the dialogues with the exception of a few hello and goodbye phrases. The dialogue menu also is a little bit weird and unusual, but you quickly get used to it. There could be more option in what your character actually says. Sometimes you mainly just click through the pre-scripted dialogues the way the writers intended it. But I like the setting and the NPCs all having a little bit of a back story and things to tell about themselves or the japanese culture and religion.\n\nGameplay in the beginning is mainly chopping wood and gathering stones and building houses, but after 3-4 hours, the management aspect starts and things get a little more interesting. All of it feels very relaxing without a lot of \"survival\" pressure or a lot of fights.\n\nAt the moment, the menus are still a bit counter-intuitive, description texts are cut off without a way to read the redacted part, but you mostly understand what the menus are trying to say with a little bit of fiddling around.\n\nthe game doesn't really explain well how the whole storage system works and which buildings exactly are required for which other building to function, but apart from that, things are pretty intuitive: You build buildings, invite refugees to live in your village, assign jobs and have them gather food and resources. In the meantime, you also complete quests to increase your technology level. \n\nVery enjoyable gameplay and already very playable despite the Early Access. The devs work hard to deliver many small patches and already improved a lot since day 1.",

The limited tool (e.g. I want Kama for harvesting the tall grass but I haven't gotten it even though I'm at dynasty level 14++\n3. Difficulty of the dynasty-level mechanism. It's so hard to gain 1 dynasty level and the effort is not paid off. I built a large bridge that takes several seasons and a huge amount of resources. But I just gain only 1 level.\n4. Difficulty of the Jobs mechanism. We can't make a village sustain itself because the demand is so much higher than the supply.\n5. Enemy. There're no challenging enemies like Tiger or the bandit camp (there's a bandit but only one).\n6. Optimization. Even though I use RTX 3060 ti, I cannot afford a high graphic setting. My PC was screaming.\n7. Audio issue. The audio in the main menu is not related to the settings\n\nI understand that this game is early access. But the price is not cheap for early access at all.

Medieval Dynasty is one of the best games, maybe may favourite, that I've ever played.  For me the issue in SD is that controls are very fiddly. To chop down a tree (something that was easy for me to the first time I played Mid Dynasty) takes three or four attempts to align to the right place.  Moving around is frustrating.  You have to long press keys which makes everything just more cumbersome. I hope this can improve. I don't think it's a performance issue. It's true that I have only 16 RAM but I have a tonne of space left on my drive, a new top end one at that, and all my drivers are up to date.  If anyone has experienced this and fixed it let me know.  I have reduced the mouse sensitivity in the controls which helped a bit.\nUpdate: I have updated my review to positive because it's still a fun and nice game to play, even though many of the features aren't ready yet (farming, etc.)  It's strongly recommended that you have a very high end PC.  The game performance really deterioates and every 45 minutes or so I have to restart steam or my whole laptop or else it becomes too slow and choppy.",

We have only played for about 6 hours and the game has frozen up at least 4 times on us and takes a good 5-10 minutes of restarting and logging back on to get it back up. The game is very quest driven at least at the beginning. It also looks like much of this game will require micro management. We both Love Medieval Dynasty, but not so keen on this one so far. We didn't get very far as we got sick of the freezes. We would consider getting a refund and maybe try it later but are past the 2 hour play time, which is silly for games like this as they require significantly longer than 2 hours to complete. More testing prior to Early Access should have been done. I have played several Early Access games and none of them have frozen.",

            "review": "Update: I noticed a few updates to the game so decided to play again and see if it's better. They definitely addressed most if not all of the QoL issues, which I very much appreciate. Nearly everything I mentioned in my original review has been touched upon in some way. Much more optimized, simpler tool management, more animals/life. It does still feel like an early access game but it's far more enjoyable now than it was at release.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI.. honestly don't know how to review this one. I both enjoy and don't enjoy this game. From reading some of the other reviews, I don't think I'm alone in this feeling. I want to like it, love it even.. but there are several quality of life things that need to be addressed. If you want to support the devs, buy now. If you want to play an enjoyable game, you should probably wait. Also, for the people looking to see how this compares to Medieval Dynasty.. I feel they're almost nothing alike. Kind of the same idea in that you build up and manage a village and that you'll need to build up your reputation to expand and grow.. but the comparison really stops there.\n\nThe game looks nice. The concept is enjoyable. The architecture is lovely. I do enjoy playing the game when I'm not feeling bogged down by all the little things that distract and detract from the experience. The key issues being:\n\nThe inventory/tool management/hotbar is a big sticking point for me. I shouldn't have to access the inventory UI anywhere near as often as I do. Making the hotbar viewable from the main screen would be a big help (and I honestly don't understand why it isn't). There are also a lot of inconsistencies around the inventory in general. For example, you can drag tools and items to the hotbar or \"quick slots\" but you cannot drag armor/clothing to your equipment slots. You'll need to select the item and hit the 'equip' key. If you have a backup tool in your inventory when your tool breaks, it will automatically replace it in your quick slots. If not, you'll have to make a new one which will not automatically replace the broken one. You'll need to open the inventory, find and drag or equip it to the quick slots again. Including if you throw your spear.. and go pick it back up... you'll have to open the inventory and find it and re-equip it. It's just a lot of tediousness that takes away from the enjoyment of the game. There seems little point in trying to make the main UI clean by hiding the hotbar, if you then have to access all the other UI to actually get anything done.\n\nThe game also feels rather lifeless. The dialog ends up looking like a text wall where you sometimes can't even differentiate between who is saying what. The dialog UI feels like it needs work overall. Speaking with NPCs should feel like an important conversation is taking place and not like you're just reading a chatbox. Also, where are all the animals and the life to the forests? The ambient sounds are great but there's little visual to back it up. I think I played for 2 hours before I ever saw an animal. In total I've only seen 4 types of animals and there are no variations. Same rabbit, same fox, boar, deer/elk/thing with antlers. Feels very.. 'game asset' and not so much 'wildlife in this beautiful forest'.\n\nThere's no way to pause the game. Even in single player. If you need to step away for a few moments, you'll need to save and exit to the menu or else come back to a starving, if not dead character. But then....\n\nThe load time.... WHY?!?! Starting the game up.. horrible load time. Loading a save... horrible load time. Exiting to the menu because you can't pause.. loading. Trying to continue where you left off before you had to exit to the menu to 'pause' the game.. please wait.. loading. In fact, the game gets a little jittery just when moving around. And I think every cutscene, even the animation in the main menu gets laggy/jittery. My PC is on the higher end and I seldom have the same level of issues in other games.\n\nI think this game has a lot of potential. I like the concepts and questlines and I've been enjoying building my little village. The map is quite large, there's tons to explore, plenty of things to build, and some interesting lore. Right now, it's just very difficult to get lost in the immersion because there are so many things breaking that immersion. You are constantly reminded that this is a game in-the-works. I believe this will become a lovely, polished game. It's just still rather rough at the moment.",

That may or may not be true (I haven't advanced to the end), but it doesn't tell the full story. The discord channel for development is active and responsive. The game itself is absolutely playable and frankly gorgeous. More than  a few times I've simply paused my adventuring to stare out at the scenery. This game will likely be a gem. A bit rough right now as far as content, but with careful polish it will be something I wear out a controller on.  This is worth the buy today, and will be DEFINITELY worth the buy in the future if it continues to be improved.",

I wanted to express my appreciation for the game \"Sengoku Dynasty\" that you've developed. I really enjoy playing it, and I have some thoughts and suggestions that I would like to share with you in order to enhance the overall gaming experience.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to mention that I am thoroughly enjoying the game. The effort you've put into creating it is evident, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to experience it. However, I also believe that there could be some exciting innovations that would set it apart from \"Medieval Dynasty\" or similar games.\n\nI've noticed the presence of bandits in the game, which I find intriguing. To make the experience even more engaging, it might be a good idea to further expand upon this concept. For example, increasing the occurrence of bandit encounters and interactions could add an extra layer of excitement. Additionally, introducing events that take place after the conclusion of a season could be captivating. Imagine scenarios where both players and NPCs have to work together to defend against bandit attacks. This cooperative gameplay could truly amplify the enjoyment factor.\n\nI want to extend my gratitude once again for your continuous efforts in developing the game. I'm eagerly anticipating discovering new and exciting features in future updates. Keep up the great work!\n\nWishing you the best of luck, and I'll strive to become a skilled player.\n\nWarm regards,\nJack_The_Ripper",

This may seem insignificant, but when you throw your spear at an animal and pick it back up mid combat, it goes into your inventory and not your tool bar... and.... you're dead. Frustrating. \n\nDo not buy yet. I would save your money until at least the second phase of their roadmap.",

I do love and hope that in the future there will be more clothing options and building choices such as freedom to create the housing in the way I would like as apposed to everything pre-fabricated builds.

Likewise in Medieval Dinasty you were not a knight in shiny armor.\n\nThumbs up if you are willing to start playing and wait an year or two to get the finished game.",

There are some missed opportunities in my opinion but that is okay. When I first started the game it took a very long time to load on my alienware but after it finalllllly did load everything worked as it should. Building is just ok to me. I do like that you are able to outline everything before you actually build it but collision mechanics could use improvement, for example I wanted to build a wall with a couple of entrance points around my whole village but was unable to place a wall on any land that had a hill and it made it very difficult (so I still don't have a wall). The quests are explained and the normal quest tracker is a big help but personally I believe there could be more quests or even some random events that pop up due to the massive war we keep hearing about that is going on that scales to your dynasty level. When my village grew and I started to need to produce items some things were not very easy to find. I did not know that the production building did not include the basic workbench for the building. (took me forever to figure out how to make buckets!!!) (This has already been patched!!) speaking of buckets why they only good for time down the well? anyways. I am up to the point now of increasing my dynasty level and I am hoping doing so will unlock more items that my village will be able to produce. I will add more after all that is done. If someone has a specific question I will try to answer in the comments. I hope this has been helpful.",

Where you could have the wooden shovel in MD, here you will get a shovel way further down the road.\n\nThese are just two differences that already freaked out other players. Personally I find it very enjoyable at the moment and am looking forward to the changes to come.",

If you allow the construction of a 2nd village, you should unlock the population limit, as well as set up all new chests.\nMore NPC actions like sawing wood, sewing clothes and cook...\nSetup npc in hunting or fighting with players, need to add a mode to pause the game and automatically rearrange the inventory.\nDamaged axes or hammers when re-crafting need to let them go to their original number slot\nAdd self-marking destination on the map, added settings for dressing villagers as well as equipping villagers with weapons.",

I am just 8 hours in, but these are my takeaways.\n\n1. When re-placing buildings down you have to completely move your building very far place it, then pick it up and bring it back. It wont allow you to just move it. Also, once a building is built you cant move it at all.\n2. The map looked big at first \"it isnt small\", but not as big as I expected. Alot of dead space, where new villages could be.\n3. Why cant I put multiple beds down in houses? Must every citizen get a house for them?\n4. Recruiting people to your town is quite confusing. I spam talked to every person I meet and still I cant figure out how to get Ako from the beach to join my town, she just sits by the water. \n5. I hope to see multiple level houses in the future, and maybe a way to clear random bushes that are clearable, as well as maybe leveling/raising areas so I can put fences down.  Connecting fences as an option would be amazing too.\n5. Once  I put a building down I cant move it all, if I decide to make my base bigger and move things around I am screwed.\n6. In the starter base there are multiple buildings= GALLOWS/tent that cant be destroyed or moved. It just blocks areas you cant build around for no reason.\n7. Why does the game essentially force you to build your first base in 1 location only? I feel like I should be able to start off an build my base anywhere I want. \n\nLove the game so far, and hopefully we see a lot of future content in the future. Might be a game I have to drop and come back in a year \"hopefully\".",

It seems very tedious for a lot of the things you have to do, and it lacks a lot of the things medieval dynasty has, which yes I am aware came with various updates, but you would think that they could have included most of that stuff if they were going to be able to already at co-op. So all in all I can really just say this game is fine. It needs more polish and I look forward to all of the new updates it will receive. I personally would rather play a medieval dynasty type game with japanese stuff painted over of it, so I will of course be keeping my eye on this game.",

Hopefully they'll have bandit raids and such since they seem to have the ability to make guards and such, which is a big thing that Medieval Dynasty needs to add. I'd like to see the game rely less on the main quest for controlling the flow of the game, and increasing the open ended aspects, especially in regards to multiplayer. I'd love to see more of a multiplayer mode that allows each player to build and trade with each other instead of just pure co-op.",

Because in about a year or so when the full release comes out then this is going to be guuuud.\n\nWhy do I think that? Well I have played Medieval Dynasty at Early Access release and Wild West Dynasty at Early Access release (let's not talk about that) and now Sengoku Dynasty. It is clear to mee that Sengoku Dynasty is following the right footsteps and is pretty much like Medieval Dynasty was when it first came out. To be honest SD feels a bit more complete and polished than MD, 3 years ago.\n\nThis is alredy a very solid start for an early access release and over the coming months this will get even better.",

            "review": "As someone who loved playing medieval dynasty on gamepass I was excited to see that there was a similar game that is set in the Sengoku period of japan. So I bought this game on release date because I'm a sucker for old japanese settings. Overall this game is great. I've ran into very few bugs that break the game. There are so many things that are fixed from medieval dynasty that make this game so much more fun. There's no carry weight instead we have a standard inventory system. While I am sad by that change most small items have high stack sizes which makes it more enjoyable especially when building. Crafting and building go way faster in this game. Which makes me feel more motivated to build and lessens the time spent doing others things in my room because I'm waiting for 10 minutes to craft 20 spears. Progression overall just seems faster which I appreciate. You no longer have to set up a dynasty near a water source as the dirtiness mechanic was taken out so no more jumping into water to avoid food poisoning. You also now have an aim ark that is visible when using the spears which makes hunting more funny and less of a gamble. The game also looks gorgeous even on the lowest graphics settings however it does mean you need a pretty powerful pc just to run those low quality graphics. This game isn't perfect however there are some small problems that I have with the game that I'm hoping will be patched in time. First if you like using a controller the controls are nothing like medieval's controls and you can't remap them which almost caused me to rage quit until I realized the keyboard existed. Second there's no setting in the video settings to choose overall graphics quality you have to adjust them all individually. It's 2023 and they didn't think to have that setting. Third NPCs have a chance to just lock you into buildings because they like to stand in door ways. Forth this was a big problem in medieval and is still a problem here. Stone tools have way too little durability and higher grade tools are very late game. I understand why this is the case but it's very annoying to go back and gather supplies to make 1 tool every 5-10 minutes. At least give a skill that lowers durability degrade or have a repair system. Fifth no survivor sense which I thought was a fun mechanic in medieval to use which would have been nice to have here as there's a lot more foliage in this game that you can't interact with. And probably the biggest problem of the whole game WHERE THE HELL ARE MY GODDAMN THICC ANIME GIRLS. THIS IS A JAPANESE GAME I THOUGHT I'D GET TO SEE SOME MASSIVE ANIME TITTIES. FUCK THIS GAME I WANTED TO GET MARRIED TO A HOT WAIFU.",

I am pleasantly surprised that the devs really delivered on the \"Sengoku\" aspect of the game by limiting progression behind requiring conquest of certain regions of the map. The difficulty and technology scale with each region that you conquer. Now, the game not only has a lot of the good village building sim features that medieval dynasty has, but also has a pretty solid combat system.\n\nNote: The game can still be buggy sometimes, issues with snow textures, and game crashes. Hopefully the devs will resolve those in the coming patches.\n\nReview From 8/14/2023:\nI wish I could leave a neutral review, and originally I left a negative review, but I will leave positive review to encourage the devs.\n\nThe state of the game as of 8/14/2023:\nThere are some bugs such as simple fetch quests being unable to resolve.\nMany features remain unimplemented such as farming, character progression, etc.\nThe trading seems unrefined, with the pricing of certain items not making sense from a financial viewpoint.\nFor example, arrows are cheaper to buy than the materials required to craft it.\nSo instead of building a hunting lodge to craft arrows, just sell the materials directly and buy the arrows at a discount.\nMy PC with a 3070 could run this just fine, but my other with a 2060 couldn't run this game on the lowest settings.\n\nOne of the misconceptions I had buying this game is that because it is named \"Sengoku\", based on the warring period of Japan. I thought I would be establishing a dynasty which would war with other clans for control of Japan. I am hoping that this game can live up to its name, because if I want to play \"peasant farming village simulator\", I can just play Medieval Dynasty.",

Its for sure more fun playing with friends while building your village! \n\nThings I noticed that could use some attention is optimization. Assigning only 1 villager to a task( I feel like you should be able to assign multiple villagers to the same task). There's probably more things but to be honest i'm enjoying to game too much to care.\n\nIll end this review with a message to my fellow gamers. The game is in early access so of course nothing is going to be perfect. That being said, I don't think the game should get negative reviews. Instead join the discord or provide feedback to the dev's so they can improve the game with our help.",

            "review": "Given early access the content is quite limited and UI and especially UX needs some polishing. There are however also clear improvements over the predecessor Medieval Dynasty. Some of the issues of that game were clearly adressed and improved in Sengoku and I am excited to see how far they can take it. Mainly its about entire systems, something that couldn't be simply patched in the previous game, because it would require complete overhaul of some areas and throw the entire rest of the balance and progression out of the window. Sengoku is a great opportunity to get this right.\nIn addition, with the little content there is, I can already see an emphasis on more interesting story and quests. In Medieval, there were too many linear fetch quests I never cared about but couldn't afford to skip. Sengoku already made the few story quests much more natural , varied and interesting. Several times I approached the quest area unsure what will happen when I I arrive and that is a vast improvement over \"Deliver X to Y\". More of that, please.\n\nSome of the promised concepts like teleports between multiple villages are simply not implemented yet, but I can't wait to see how Sengoku Dynasty will grow and mature. Already now I had a blast playing, faced relatively little frustration and I will wait patiently for every piece of the upcoming content.\n\nOne area where I dont agree with the direction the game took so far is storage areas. In Medieval, you needed 2 basic storage facilitites and you were set. Here every village needs at least 4, later the fifth and just figuring out what goes where is sometimes quite a chore. This goes together with new inventory management, but it was a significant point of frustration for me early on.",

It may be a better Single-Player experience, but the Co-Op has a lot of flaws.\n\n- Things progress without everyone doing it, this might not be that problematic later in the game, but Tutorial Quests should require all players actually doing them so one doesn't miss out on information.\n\n- Horrible Netcode. The game runs fine for me.... until i play Co-Op. Then the game just becomes near unplayable.\n\nIMO idk why some developers still insist on Peer-to-Peer connection for their Sandbox Survival Games in 2023. This game could benefit a lot from Servers.",

I'm playing with a friend and that's the only reason I'm still trucking along.  Other than being stable enough to not crash, this feels like an alpha to me.  The pieces of this game are like a puzzle.  The border is together and there are clumps of pieces together, but it's too far from being complete.  For example the water looks and sounds great from the top, but head into the lake and you'll be running along the bottom of it like the water doesn't exist.  It's not that I don't understand what early access means but again.  It's REALLY early.\n\nThis game isn't really survival: food mgmt is minimal, no water for you, only for villagers, no death penalty.  More of a city mgmt but the UI is so confusing that there's no pleasure in it.  For building, you put down a small house.  The way you add the resources is cool, but you aren't designing anything.  It's a sloggy grind!",

I was under the impression that the controller support would be very similar to medieval dynasty, however this is not the case. This is the worst controller layout I have ever seen in any game. None of the buttons are logical some bindings just simply do not work.\n\nIf, like in my prime, you are able to  use keyboard and mouse then I think this game will be very enjoyable and well worth investing in early, however if, like me currently, you rely on a controller, then avoid this game - at least for now\n\nNote, i tried multiple times to reconfigure the controller layout to no success, buttons would not respond etc.\n\nThe controller layout for this game must have been created/designed by someone who has never used a controller to play a game before. I give it a thumbs up because the game itself isn't the issue and it wouldn't be fair to not recommend based on accessibility.",

Overall I'm enjoying learning the game and watching this game grow and come into its own.",

It’s the first of the dynasty games that I’ve played.\nThere are some things that I am not a fan of though\n\nI’ll start off with some of the bugs that I’ve noticed.\n- Fall damage while vaulting obstacles\n- Crashes while trying to load a save while in-game\n- Random FPS drops\n- Character freezes after exiting the build menu (hammer/hand menus)\n- Mask/hat overlays appear while in 1st person (can’t see)\n- NPCs getting stuck in buildings\n- Can equip things that you shouldn't be able to (Dragging a tool from the equip bar over a resource)\n\nThere weren’t that many bugs, but they sure are an annoyance for me. The next couple of things aren’t really issues, more so just little details that are intriguing.\n- Infinite sprint (B-hop to infinity)\n- Bug sounds in winter\n- Bandit symbol overlay even after death (I like this one, but it gets annoying when it’s there for the whole day)\n   No option to turn down the menu music (It’s a little loud)\n- “If you think your salvation is assured, it is assured; if you think it is not assured, it is not assured -Kenko” (Cool quote… \n   but it’s the only quote)\n- REALLY LONG game start and load (I’ve got an alright PC, it shouldn’t take so long)\n- NPC movement from afar looks a little weird (looks like their moving at 15fps)\n\nThese aren’t too bad, just a little weird. The next are things I'd like to see in the game.\nMore skill tree options\n- Dialogue option with bandits (it would be nice to give them a chance to live, Right?)\n- Other villages tab (shows available trade and maybe some other cool details, lore and facts about the village)\n- More quotes (the first one isn’t bad, but it is the only one)\n- Footprints in snow (it would be neet)\n- Swimming animation and a tread through water animation (either the character is made from the core of a dead star, or \n   the water is about as dense as air)\n- Some sort of damage overlay when taking damage (wasn’t paying attention, had my volume down, died to a boar)\n- Needed resources for available buildings while holding the hammer (when I hold the hammer it would be nice to see what \n   I need to finish building a structure without needing to go up to said structure)\n- Increased animal detection range during winter (the air is cold, sound is gonna travel faster)\n- Customizable character (I know it is just a beta, but I’de like to look a little different)\n- More looks for NPC’s\n- Foods last longer while in storage (it would be nice if the foods magically lasted longer while in storage)\n- Owned house overlay while in build mode (I assigned myself a house but I don’t know which one it is)\n- Progression message for blocked areas (first time playing I tried looking for the villages before I built the bridge)\n- Requirements message to unlock certain buildables (how many and what quests need to be done to build this building?)\n- Leaf color change during the different months (it would be pretty)\n- Some Npc noises (feels like i'm talking to a mannequin)\n- Reputation with other villages/ppl/groups\n- A select all button when transferring items\n- Bushes to small trees to big trees (I cut down a lot of trees by me, and I don’t like needing to go so far to find more)\n- Apparel durability (it would suck, but then I would have a higher incentive to make more)\n- Apparel protection level\n- Apparel reputation (wearing bandit clothes would make people suspicious and wearing elite clothing would do the \n  opposite)\n\nThese are all the concerns I could think of in the time that I’ve played so far. I really like the game, but it can get a little monotonous at times. I know that this is not a finished game yet, so there are a lot of quality of life improvements not yet added. I think the game is at a playable point but it could definitely use a few touch-ups.\n",

The devs are working very hard and the whiny twats in the comment section are pissing me off a bit. If you consider playing the game then do. If you get bored then just wait for the next update like I did. I think the devs deserve more credit then they are getting for it.\n\nIt is set in an intresting point in history and one of the few historically accurate japanese games I have played that has more to it then \"Hey look samurai with swords they're cool!\" and is set from the point of view of a peasant fleeing from samurai and noblemen in a civil war (Or something like that I wasn't paying attention in history class 30 something years ago) \nThe graphics are amazing and the exploration is enjoyable, \nThe art and music is amazing and it feels good to get a village up and running.\nI am certain the game will have a lot more content when it is fully released.\nThe game does not perform to well (This may be an issue on my end or my pc specs or just early access stuff)\nThe map is not very big. (And there are only two towns beyond your own and the monastary but nothing much beyond that, other then Granted with fast travel it is a lot more convenient it kind of removes an exploration aspect of the game like encountering random events from bandits to refugees to even a tavern I found. And much less exitingly a merchant, granted you can still travel if you choose to so it isn't too bad.\n\n",

While it's evident that there's a lot of work to be done, I appreciate that it's in early access and thus a work in progress. My friend and I have already spent numerous enjoyable hours playing, and we're genuinely excited about the game's potential.\n\nOne suggestion I'd like to offer is the addition of server functionality for multiplayer. It would be fantastic if players could host their own servers for a small group of friends, even if the player cap is limited to four. This feature would eliminate the need to wait for the person holding the save file to be available, allowing everyone to enjoy the game at their convenience.\n\nOverall, I'm optimistic about the direction the game is heading and am eagerly looking forward to its continued development. I believe that with ongoing improvements, it has the chance to become something truly remarkable.\n\nThank you for your hard work on the game, and I can't wait to see how it evolves in the future!",

The movement feels good, and the combat, at least with spears, feels good.\nThe map is massive and beautiful to look at. It does feel a bit empty but it also should. There's tons of amazing views and interesting places.\nThere's also already a working storyline that seems pretty interesting and a quest system that is decent so far.\nOf course there's tons missing. There's only a couple perks from levelling up, progression in terms of a village seems slow, and the economy feels very unbalanced in a good way. (you can sell 30 seconds of grass gathering for an iron tool)\nAs long as this game keeps being actively developed I think this will be an amazing game.",

The co-op is allot of fun and being able to play a dynasty game with your friends and loved ones is just the icing on the cake. I like that it doesn't spoon feed you on how to do things. It lets you work it out and I like this allot. \n\nIts early access so bear in mind its early days I love the changing of the seasons this is one of the best things about this game is watching the world change around you.\n\nThere is a Main Story quest line that you need to get through in order to unlock more crafting stations. I haven't worked out if they have added all stations or not since its EARLY DAYS. Which I know they will bring out in time, people just need to be patience. So for those that down vote this game its sad to see these developers are very passionate about their games and I know from their other games it will take time to finish. As the saying goes Rome wasn't built in a day. So be kind and give support to this wonderful game and its devs.\nThe Host has control over the Quest progression so that blocks trolls and players cant kill you big plus that its PVE and when you host a open game.\n\nWould Like to see added.\n\nA Auto Sort Button in storage.\nA wheel barrow or a cart to you can collect more and get big loads to your building projects across the world.\nWould like to see trees and plants ect grow back.\nIf I can think of more, I will add more later.  \n\nDislikes\nAiming with the bow is kinda difficult. \nTools durability is really low, breaks very easy eg Iron Tools dont last much longer then stone. Which was disappointing.  \n\nBugs\nArrows getting stuck in bushes when hunting or trying to kill a bandit.\nHosting a game seems to get shuddering  after awhile\nThe Bow sometimes seems to have a wave affect over it sometimes and the aim is a bit hard to get used to\nChanging Tools seems to bug out when you try to change tools or weapons. So have pressing it a few times to get it to work now and then.\n\n\nNote for New players\n\nLook out for Wild Boar you will get OWNED :P\nHappy hunting! <3\n\n",

I've so far changed seasons only once, from spring to summer, so I don't know if there might be a lot of broken things during fall or winter.\n\nIf I find that I don't like the game, or something comes up in the story that immediately sets off warning flags in my head (like forcing you to kill a hundred babies to save a horse or whatever,) then I'll change  my review to not recommend it. For now thought it's a good game just starting off, and as long as you're aware that it's in very early access then go ahead. \nCrash to the shore and build up your dynasty from the burning embers of your past.",

            "review": "I, honestly cannot figure out why there are ANY bad reviews on this game unless you don't like realistic city builder games... especially after the WWD fiasco.Wild West Dynasty deserved bad reviews, it was amazingly boring and almost unplayable. I've even tried to go back to it after some big updates and been equally as bored. But THIS game, Sengoku Dynasty  is neither of those. I got sucked in pretty quickly and once I got going and figured out the controls, which do still need some work, I was hooked. If you liked Medieval Dynasty, you WILL like this one. They are very very similar. I am still very confused about the Management side of things and using the word \"Furniture\" for the word \"storage\" has been quite confusing for me, being an American. LOL. But once I figured that out, it hasn't been too much of an issue. I'm still a bit confused about making a building for Food, but then needing to add food storage's into the Food storage building in order for people to get what they need.... very confusing and my people are saying we don't have supplies, when we do in all those storage containers inside the buildings... again, I'm still a bit confused on how all that is supposed to work. I do like the idea of being able to add as many different types of storage containers and work benches that you want to each building, so I see where the devs were going with it, but it needs to be explained better somewhere in the game cause it can be quite confusing. Medieval Dynasty was much much simpler and user friendly in that respect, but it took years to get to the point it is now and I expect some things to change over time in this game to make the management much easier. I was also confused on the skill tree and why it is SOOO limited? There's only like 3 skills to obtain? Games usually have a lot more than 3 skills to get... but again, maybe the devs are still adding to those over time. Overall, if your okay with playing a game in \"early access\", which this game is, and dealing with the fact that it is not a complete game, but will get better and better over time, then get this game. Early Access means your getting to play a game that is not completed yet... hence, Early \"Access\". I love it so much more than I did WWD... if you bought that game and were horribly disappointed, do NOT let that keep you from getting this game... it is miles ahead of that one. I have had zero game breaking bugs so far and I haven't gotten bored with it yet. There is a lot to do... a lot of quests that are keeping me busy and entertained. There are active NPC's everywhere so it is not a deserted wasteland by any means. A lot of the NPC's are interactive... so much so that I couldn't decide who I wanted to interact with first in a big town.  I am enjoying building, as I did with Medieval Dynasty. I just haven't figured out how to get people to join my town. I have 2 people I got through starter quests, but I haven't had any luck with any other NPC's just yet... I am assuming the quests I'm working on now will lead me to more people joining my town. So far so good and I'm loving this game! Truly. Without giving out any in game spoilers here, there is a point where you climb up a tall tower for a quest and doing that leads you to the Official Game Title.... that part is sooo cool! The devs will know what part I'm referring to...  Please do not remove that from the game cause I was in awe of it. It was an amazing sight to see. I just ask that people stop giving this Early Access game such bad reviews... it is not a bad game for an Early Access and it will only get better and better over time. Sometimes I think people buy an early access game and think it's a finished product... it's not. I understand what a really bad early access game looks like, cause WWD was one of the worst early release games I have ever bought... this one is no where near that and I'm enjoying it very much as it is now. On a side note, as others have stated,  I would also like to see some voice overs on the NPC conversations... that would be nice, although I know a lot of games just leave those as read text and do not add voice-overs.. I'm good either way, but it's always better when an actor reads out parts of a story... so I get why people ask for it. Anyways, if you like builder, city management games, farming, doing some grinding work that is satisfying, feeling like your starting a new town in a time long ago in Japan, this is the game for you! The accuracy of the time period is also very good. Easy thumbs up for me!\n\nUPDATE: Since the last update, the game has become unplayable. I have spent hours trying fixes and workarounds suggested to me by devs and other players, but nothing is working. The game has become completely unplayable for me. I even started a brand new game and letting go of the 20+ hours I put into this so far, but same thing.... fatal error crash after 10-30 minutes of playing and I also lose all my progress for some reason cause when I restart the game, it's way back at the beginning again. I'm just tired of playing the beginning of this game over and over hoping it won't crash on me. I'm gonna move on to another game until they fix this issue. The crash error is \"LowLevelFatalError\" and I'm running on Windows 11, NVIDIA RTX 3080ti, Intel i9 12900KF, 32GB RAM",

I still would recommend this game to anyone and especially for people that want to play together. Many people are talking about FPS issues and overall performance, I play on a lower end pc that doesn't even meet the 16gb ram (mine is 15.93) and I play almost perfectly. My only gripe is the controller support is a bit wonky. It works for the most part but sometimes the controls freeze up. so far 7/10 for me. Looking at the roadmap it is clear that this game could be better than MD.",

There's only a few quests, a lot of things aren't unlockable yet, yada yada, but I am blown away by what is already here. I'm a huge fan of Medieval Dynasty so that but feudal Japan?! So in! I'm loving the game and I can't wait to see what comes. The devs have already pushed out a couple patches (so fast!) and there's so much to do and explore, even if it's lacking it's full features. I never expect a fleshed out game from Early Access releases, so to get almost 25 hours in and still have things to do is fantastic to me. I think what has been put in the game already is great and I look forward to what the devs have in store!",

            "review": "Ok lets get one thing on out of the way and question i have been asked lot how well does this game compare to Medeival Dynasty well as far as day one of early access release Medeival Dynasty you could get married have kid and grow up and play as them and you could plant stuff and farming and about 5 villages to visit and explore and had great dynasty levleing system  Now for Sengoku Dynasty you cant get married and have kid and grow old and play as them no farming  and worst dynasty levleing system ever and not single player friendly at all and worst tavern i have ever saw in game just huge empty building with small firepit and one small light logs dont stack and the special request missions take like 150 to 200 is stupid \n it takes that many it should only take 50 logs at most and take more planks since planks stack at least also lot of the special request missions take lot of seasons to complete to that turns this game into a sleeping simulator cause you cant just skip season back to back you got wait 2 days after skipping one so you got sleep back to back then skip then sleep back to back again skip and do this alot for the ones that require 5 workers assigned  so lets say scale 1-10 on day one even first month of early access release MD is 10 and SD is a 5 and wouldnt even give it a 5 as far as content compared to content that was avaible on day one of early access only reason i give SD 5 is it has less bugs if we go by content we had availbe day one of early access between MD 10 and SD is like a 2  when toplitz has devs add ability for us to farm and get married and have kid then and give us ability to place funiture that goes in different production builings outside like the npc villages i will give this game a thumbs up but for the price tag its just not worth it right now!!! Beautiful game and good mechanics bust worst grind game ever played in my 51 year old life i have 35 hours in and have run around like a mad man and still havent unlocked the fisher hut or major building you need for crafting and no farming so far as i see for growing crops so they have the brew building and tavern and rest of the crafting building  lock to deep behind special quest that you have to find all over map to level up your dynasty and you have to wait till next season for it to complete so dont look for any fun stuff tillll late late extremely late and i am talking prob over hundred of hours before you get to unlock them cause like i said i have run all acroos map trying get them done and with you haveing wait till next season not good and you dont get xp for everyting you do like farming gathering hunting in medieval dynasty if you did then maybe sengoku dynasty would be bun and the  fast travel from bell to bell dont work you have to assign your self a bed in next village and use unstuck then if you want go back do reverse and it takes off health . I would recommend the game if theyr removed the locks once you got to dynasty level 9 but almost level 10 and still havent been able to unlock major building like tavern and the smithy i unlock lot of the stuff you can make guess what locked to so the minor crafting building you unlock you cant even craft much cause locked way on down line in dynasty level and only way to level your dynasty i have found so far is doing quest which stop at level 7 and tell you reach level 14 so now you have do special quest which scattered all over map and if you dont explore every inch of map even the corners you may not find and so guess what that will hurt you levleing further . Come on devs let us get xp thru our char thru gathering and hunting and building like we did in medievla dynasty dont lock us behind damn quest wall and special quest that take a entire season to complete so that forces us to skip seasons and oh for some reason i cant even make my villagers in second village go cut wood since but a scond wood cutter in it so cant even send out any in first village either so looks like what ever village you have your first building like wood cutter and  foorage building in is one for all of your villages and you can only assign one person as there is only one perso nassign tab per building and no body wants to skip seasons but you forceing us take years off our char lives worst mechanic ever to unlock crafting buildings .Oh and let me tell you matia gave me quest get her  3 eggs and 8 gobo and i did and tried giving her them raw and cooked and guess what she had have them before next season but every time i try turn in and no option to give them to her when talk to her all was is i am still looking or see ya later  . I will say toplitz did make huge improvements over their disaster of wild west dynasty and made smart move made sure use different devs and used unreal engine 5 and on that part if they fix the lock wall they put all the crafting behind and also in china and japan they growed rice and vegitebile why do we not have option to grow stuff and farm lmao you got drying grass only option besides compostier under farming also they had farm animals you need add cows and ducks and chickens yes they lived off ice and you dont even give us option to gow that all i have found option fo rice is to buy it not even seeds  come on devs 35 hours in and you even got the dang cooking pot locked behind what i have complained about you making a game that could be fun into a terrible game please fix this aspa and stop making us wait entire season cause with you locking the furth leveling behind those quest forcing us get old fast wtf 35 hours in and cant even build the biggest house lol and that is running around like mad man and even trying to do several special request  quest at one time so when i am forced skip season to progress further it dont age me as much oh and every one did i mention lot of building dont unlock unless you do those special request very very bad system . Every one loved medieval dynasty cause if you killed a deer you leveld if you farmed you leveled .games are suppose be fun not harder work then you would have to work in real life people play games to relax have fun. I do like killing the wandering bandits and exploreing the map and talking to all the npcs and all the different stories each of them have . Oh and boars are way op i have been killed twice while talking to npcs and couldnt cancel convo one hit to 2 from boar boom you dead and that was with best armor on. I wouldnt not buy this game unless you looking for a second job as slave  cause atm way the dynasty level sytem is and no xp for anything you do besides quest and like i said the quest stop at level 7 and you have find special quest to progress further building and giveing new homes to reugees dont even give dynasty xp .so you sota stuck and cant caft much and i am over 35 hours and to point i dont even want play it further https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvlZvuquOkk&t=43s    take look for your selfs and you welcoem take look at my other vids from the begining and i would advise for you to before you do buy the game so you know what you getting into is game beautiful and is on unreal engine 5 so lots room for it to improve in future i just dont like not being able cook meals i even stole a cooking pot but can build dang beter cooking system yet and oh be sure go around steal  iron tools and they break easy to but not as bad as the stone everything breaks to fast",

            "review": "Sengoku Dynasty feels like they made a sanbox survival game, realized it's 5 hours long, and gated everything behind pointless quests and level requirements. \n\n\nNow, the game is early access and while it doesn't make it immune to criticism it would be pointless to point out small bugs and things that are already on their roadmap.\n\nBut if you look at the store page, what does Sengoku Dynasty promise?\n[i]Build and manage villages[/i].\n\nSure, you can put down buildings, if you've done enough chores to get the permission to do so, but there's barely any reason to. \n90% of the building you can build look the same. You have 3 wood types and they all look the same.\nAll interesting building in trailer and promo pictures are npc owned, you can't build them, you can't use them, you can't build near them. You get same wooden hut 20 times over.\nYou can't build roads to them. You can't build near existing ones. You can't remove flowers from under them. \nThere's some, very obvious flat open areas for building and then it's npc villages and unbuildable hills, which barely feels like open world.\n\nManaging the village needs can be done in a day and is set for years after that.\nThere's 3 animals that have worse AI that minecraft has.\nIt's the era of samurais but there's none in the game, the combat is punching boars with spear, with zero weight behind the hits, and your biggest enemies are actually 2 meter hills, that take 1/3 your hp if you dare jump off one.\n\nQuests are barebones \"walk for 20 minutes, kill 2 boars, walk 20 minutes again\" level on stuff..\n\nAnd what's on the roadmap? MORE QUESTS???, perks and farming building... And that's coming in \"next months\" timescale.\nThat's just simply not going to fix anything.\n\n\nNow, anything can be fun co-op, no matter how bad the game is, and if you can run around almost naked, laugh at flying animals and process trees to planks, you can get couple fun sessions out of the game.\n\nBut if you're playing this game solo it's a 1/5, and that's how it's going to stay for a WHILE, regardless of updates.",

If you're content with taking your time and building up your skills and getting your village going, you'll be happy with the current state of the game.  If, however, you're looking for tons of content and constant questing, you'll probably find yourself getting impatient.  We are in the early stages of EA and there's alot of work to be done.  The developers are listening closely to comments and suggestions and I find that very encouraging.\n\nThere are complaints that this is just a rehash of Medievel Dynasty - same game, different graphics.  I have to strongly disagree!  Although there are many of the same logistics, the very tone and style of the game are very different.  I really don't get the sense that I'm playing the same game.  It seems that the direction we're going in is very different and more complex than Medievel Dynasty.  For example, I just received a nice armor piece as a quest reward.  And I can see that, once I level up a bit, I'll be able to craft a pretty 'schnazzy' Katana.  I think many of the 'disgruntled' Medieval Dynasty players will be very encouraged by that.\n\nAt the current discounted price, I think it's definitely worth a buy, even if it sits in your sock drawer until more content is added.  You won't be disappointed.",

It fully allows you to put yourself into the shoes of someone who lived in that time and place. You'll quickly have to start collecting items and build tools & structures to survive, and the game makes it fairly simple with an accessible wheel of options you can quickly open, a welcome change from many survival games that make it all extremely complex at the start. The problem is that sometimes the game doesn't tell you what exactly you should do, giving you simple objectives like \"use the hammer to build a tent\" without any further objective markers or direction, same with the story related objectives. The animals and hunting systems are still in need of work, along with the confusing map and some of the UI.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics & Sound[/b][/h1]\nVisually the game looks great, with some minor improvements that could still be done to improve performance. The music and sound design are also very good and fit with the general vibe of the game, helping you embrace the world much more.\n\n[h1][b]Content[/b][/h1]\nThe major issue with the game is the lack of content. It clearly has a ton of groundwork already done to make for an amazing game and even have an interesting plot, but at the moment, with all the heavy crafting and building elements and not much else, it feels like another typical survival game like many we have already seen and not an ambitious period life sim like some of the other games in the Dynasty series.\n\n[h1][b]Technical Aspects[/b][/h1]\n🔹 This review was completed on a Desktop PC. The specs for this unit are as followed.\n🔹 CPU: Intel I5-12600KF\n🔹 RAM: 32GB DDR4\n🔹 Graphics Card: GigaByte GeForce RTX 3070ti\n\nA few minor stutters when walking through lots of tall grass.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]\n[b]Sengoku Dynasty[/b] is a highly engaging life sim with loads of groundwork and potential to be an incredible game, but it feels like it could heavily benefit from some more time in the oven.",

If you want to host a private serve,  a password is made for you at random. You cant make your own password and it changes every-time you launch it in Co-op. \n\n*For the other person to get to your server you need to check the password box and then put in the password and hit refresh for it to pop up in the list. * (for those who don't know) \n\n2. The towns storage are connected really no point in multiple towns if you cant have one going and starting fresh with another. Be nice to at least have the option to connect the storage or not. ( I Guess that's what you get with co-op vs multiplayer. Still i would at least like to have the option even in the single player. )\n3. Not many animals around, winter you see more rabbits. \n\nIt is early Access so hopefully later on things will change and gets better.",

            "review": "I will revisit in a year or so.\n\nI'm quite disappointed in what this game is offering, because all i can think whilst i'm playing it, is that i could be playing Medieval Dynasty (MD).\n\nThere are a number of points i dislike:\n\n-It feels like they have taken the crafting setup of MD and tweaked it to make it annoying, i think people would really struggle if they had not played MD previously. Having to add in crafting stations after building a structure is frustrating although i can see the late game benefits of this (designing your own layout of a workstation). Maybe adding in a workstation to a workstation could be more late game for the more advanced structures.\n-Couldn't work out how to craft a shovel, when you're chopping trees, the stump gives an extra log when you use a shovel, this should be available early game. It feels like a complete chore cutting down trees, maybe it's just me, do trees grow back? Who knows.\n-Benefits from workers (including assigning yourself) are not real time, they are seasonal, so assign yourself to gather wood, you then have to make sure you have axes in your -general storage- and room in -your inventory- at the end of season so the resources have somewhere to go, I feel this is a very flawed design. I worked hard to build a wood storage in time for the first season to tick over. So you can read into that a lot of mechanics which aren't made clear.\n-UI is poor including the map details, can't pin or scroll, tracking quest buttons don't work you have to click it. I can't work out what my villagers actually need and how they'll be affected, i'm pretty sure the number of almost 2k meals for 3 of us per season is incorrect. Then you get plus or minus happiness predictions for the end of season which I cannot fathom.\n-One of the first quests outside of the village received from the hunter, he told me to go South when in fact the target was NNE.\n-Villagers wander around doing nothing during the day and night, night also feels far too long.\n-You feel entirely rushed at the start of the game, forced into building your village where the game wants you to.\n-After traversing the map, it really is small and devoid of life - hostile creatures include singular boars and singular bandits which take 3 hits to kill. \n-The map layout is such that it's clear where the devs want you to build 'your own village'.\n-You get a guide when you aim your spear/bow which is annoying, if you aim too high (which wasn't high at all) your character resets their stance so you have to re-aim.\n-You cannot hold down E to gather, some early game structures require 300 straw = 600 grass, 1 grass gather gives an average of 2 per... hello RSI.\n-Underdeveloped talents/specs. I thought you could choose a 'Way of the...' but you can just put 2-3 points in about 3 of the 4, with stats that seem quite overpowered for the amount of time you play the game, I unlocked everything currently on offer in a few hours.\n-Lots of placeholders e.g. when you come across a random camp you can see coin pouches, hammer, cloth wrapped something which are all unlootable.\n-I don't think you can 'steal' in the game, not that you can loot most of the containers you find anyway\n-Small and medium houses only give enough space for 1 villager\n\nI got to the end of Autumn but between Spring-Summer-Autumn it felt like there was hardly any change at all in availability of resources and presentation of flora and character, it rained a bit more in Autumn that's about it.\n\n\nI liked:\n-The music, made me feel like i was across the ocean from MD\n-The theme\n-Visuals\n\n:(\n",

Haven't had to touch the settings which set to epic across the board. Game looks beautiful & music is awesome, setting the scene.  Sound effects are easy on the ear & suit tasks being done. Tutorial is unobtrusive & flows well. Animations could use a little polish but suffice just as they are. Game play is good & menus intuitive, easy to navigate. \n\nNot sure what people expect for $25 but I call this good value if this is your kind of game. \n",

            "review": "I'm torn on this title, I almost want to give it a negative review but the survival crafting aspect is really great. Its  like actually walking the footsteps as a peasant in medieval Japanese times, barely eking out an existence. You can really feel the amount of love the developer has pumped into this game, from focusing on Shinto to traditional naming conventions, you get the idea this is a passion project of theirs.\n\nWhich brings me to the negative part of the game, which is also the main part of it. The town building/management. It's horrible. It took me almost an hour just to build a basic house (which isn't terrible in and of itself, but gives you an idea of how grindy it is). Your villagers require certain amount of food and water to remain happy/loyal. The problem is, is that you can only supply them with food IF you have a food storage building, NOT food storage containers. Same goes for water. And logs. And tools. You need to practically build an entire village before you can even have 1 person in it. Speaking of food, I ran across a cart that had a ton of food in it and dumped it into my food storage building and it still wasn't enough to feed em. I'm talking close to 30 pieces of meat, 75 eggs, 20 gabo shoots, and 5 fish. All cooked. My people still starved. In my travels, I only saw 3 hares, managed to kill 1. It gave me 1 meat. I don't see how it's possible to even play the game with that level of difficulty for food. Same goes for water. Once you build a well, you don't just get water, you also need to build a bucket.....per time that you use it and you don't even start off with one (which there's a hidden one if you're careful when looking for supplies when you wash ashore). And you cant build a new bucket from scratch.... you need a whole building for it. I have a carpenter, but she just won't cut wood (the system is very convoluted) You have to have all the buildings built for it; log cutters, log storage building with storage containers in it, general storage with storage containers in it with axes per wood type. then you have to micromanage who works where, what they're going to cut down (looks like she can only cut down 2 trees), what tools they're going to use, where to drop off the resources.... at this point the town management system is not fun and half the time it doesn't even work. The RPG system is also barebones, I'm hoping its just placeholder till they get something better in its place.\n\nMy advice.... most of this stuff should be automated (tell someone to chop down trees and they just do it), the storage BUILDINGS done away with entirely (combine them into the production buildings), lower the grind a tad (I cut down all the trees in a 3km radius so I really don't see how a log cutter npc that's gonna get me 2 trees is ever going to help), make supplying your people's needs easier (as well as making the well easier to use).\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun, the world is very engaging, with little details that are strewn about that catch your imagination. Just don't try to build a settlement.",

Graphically the game is Beautiful however the game play as it currently stands will maybe occupy you for 10-20 hours before you may look to other games just due to it being in development without fully realised systems, mechanics and polish. \nHowever, if you are willing to see past some of the jank expected with an EA game and wish to support the devs I suggest picking up this game, and returning every 3/6 months after hopefully we get some big updates.\n\nReally hope the combat is fleshed out allot compared to the publishers predecessor Medieval Dynasty and learn from it's short comings. Would love to see more survival elements with bandit raids on the village and maybe even being able train and command villagers to become warriors but I don't know how much scope the devs intend. Also I wonder if there will be any scope for terramorphing, and if not maybe implement a building which is a small/medium/large raised flat platform from stone so we could build cool hill villages on slopes.",

Maybe have it as a setting like: \n\n\"How much villager freedom do you want for decorating/building?\"\n\"They can build the village and I'll watch/help\"\n\"I'll handle the buildings, they'll handle furniture and decorations around town\"\n\"Villagers will only decorate their assigned homes\"\n\"I want full control\"",

However this game is very fun and enjoyable if you can get into it, I see a few people comparing it to some of the other Dynasty games I'll just say this its a different title with a different Dev team and generally when these things are first release they're really rough around the edges (an example of that would be GTA Online in GTA V). Now with that they have made a very good introduction to the game with several planned features I'd love to see a few features added in the future but again the game has been out two days and again early access . You can tell the Devs enjoy what their doing with broadcasting the game and being very active in the discussions. They also are working on bug fixing a lot of issues off the bat within a day of release a hot-fix was released. This is all to say its enjoyable its nowhere close to done but shows a lot of promise with an active and committed Dev team. I'm eager to see more features come out and see where the story line goes",

You spend your time chopping wood/building an xtra house rinse repeat... The map is lifeless, npc are boring, wildlife boring, poi very rare... I wish this one would be different  than MD with more choices player can do, a nice/rewarding hunt system with rare animals, some cool character, you get along or not, giving you a sense of immersion. More skills to develop, better economy and diplomacy/feud, and of course something a bit more exciting when it comes to building/crafting stuff. But nope rinse repeat MD with a Japanese style (the new spiritual system is a joke so far). What's next? Could be promising but I'm pretty sure it gonna take years just to have a copy of what one can already do in MD.",

Quest are bugged somewhat and they need to implement a better system for workers but the buildings and storage system works pretty well and the view is beautiful  even down to the lightening. The game runs pretty good on my system ive seen a couple of hiccups  while running when in 3rd person view,  other than that really no problems. I hate the fact that i cant zoom in on the map nor can i mark the map and they must be implementing that because in the legend there is a key for it. I hate when you put on hats your hair disappears and your bald but the clothing is nice there is no armor rating system  it would be nice if they had character customization maybe in the future oh and no voice overs just reading the quest line but overall its very early in its stages and if these developers are anything like the developers of Medieval Dynasty it will get 100 percent better over time and that why i bought it . I love Japanese titles and its looks awesome and it will be......... in time!",

It has optional co-op! Wanna play with your friends? Have fun! Are you an introverted loner like me? That's fine too! Everything you can do in co-op you can do alone, if a little slower.

I found the game to be not very fun mainly due to how jank it felt along with questionable mechanics to operate the village. My reasons for refunding are too numerous to count from poor UI, performance and simply a lack of fun across the board. It was basically a logging simulator and it didn't even manage to get that right with how quickly you need to replace your axe and how quickly it is destroyed, in addition to the tree falling animations being somethings like from a play station two era game.\n\nI previously had commented that the lack of farming at launch was a big reason as to why I refunded, however it was just one of many. A dev felt compelled to lock my review and comment that \"farming is coming in the roadmap\". I am aware of the roadmap, the comment was made because it seems foolish to launch a game when you don't even have farming in place yet. What kind of village can't farm?\n\nThe game just wasn't for me & I love survival / building / city sim games. That should say something. Hopefully this review wont get censored, I'd hate to go into even greater detail next time.\n\n",

It's very stable and plenty of content for EA. It's a must buy for any Medieval Dynasty fan.\n\nI have no clue why this game has Mixed reviews.

A game called sengoku dynasty that has neither sengoku nor dynasty in it.  \n\nImagine a developer picking the most violent and turbulent period in japan's history, and then glibly declaring they are going to make a \"peaceful builder\". \n\nThere was no peaceful life during that period.  if you could hold a stick, someone was going to chain your leg to a stake and give you one to fight for your life or die trying.  If you had iron, someone was coming for it.  if you had rice, someone was coming for it. The same goes for sake, women, two coins to rub together\n\nit was the period of misery and warfare, and in this period of brutal social upheaval the developers are going to make a 1st person animal crossing\n\nDo you hear that grinding noise?  That's the ghost of Akira Kurosawa spinning in his grave.\n\nI thought this title was cute until I read what the developers intended.  Now I think it's a travesty and the most tragic of missed opportunities.  What should have been about an ikki - peasants standing up for themselves and fighting the good fight in a turbulent period is instead an offence against reason, history, and sensibility.  \n\nI hope the developer comes to their senses.",

            "review": "This game isn't even remotely close to ready, even for an early access release. There might be 8 hours of content before what little there is to do dries up. Medieval dynasty launched with far more content and optimization. I'm not sure why this game is getting a pass by a number of users simply because it was an early access release, we have countless examples of well done EA releases that offer far more content, replayability and optimization (and for less money). \n\nThis isn't a journey with the developers like some would attempt to suggest, there are core features of a \"dynasty\" game that simply aren't in the game, and there's no amount of player input that is going to impact their implementation. The game simply needs more time. Having a partial map virtually devoid of life, with a few towns, a few quests and a few structures to build doesn't qualify this as a healthy EA release.\n\nI will revisit this game when it actually has some of the core mechanics necessary to enjoy a dynasty style game for more than a few hours, and I will adjust my review accordingly, but until then, this review is staying negative. \n\nWait for Medieval Dynasty co-op if you are looking for a good dynasty co-op experience or just simply wait if you were looking for a good single player experience in this game.",

Even if they fix that so you can finally advance to 21 and build everything, you just know in your gut that half that garbage ain't gonna work right either or open up successfully.  It's just one thing after another, hare traps don't work half the time (been this way for months after another update), it's just so many bugs to deal with that randomly seem to appear with the next update.  Almost 200 hours in and I've both said yes and no to recommending this game a dozen times, unfortunately for now, I got to stick with no...  Seriously, now they instituted penalty for death, my first death cost me 7,500 coins and 60 meats, isn't that a bit freaking excessive especially since you won't let me put my coin anyplace else like under my bed, just a lame experience from a lame game?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!",

            "review": "Here are the issues that are making the game I spent over a year anticipating and received as a birthday gift:\n1. The map. It's awful and barely legible. You can't zoom in. The markers are white while they use white to also add artistic detail for the map itself so I can't read a thing.\n2. Hunting. Barely any animals spawn and you have no ability to \"sense\" like in Medieval so I can't even find blood trails or collectibles. It doesn't seem like hitting deer even does anything to it unless it's a headshot. In Medieval any significant blow to an animal slows them down (and leaves a blood trail for you to see and sense.) There are also no notification of animal areas and no way to view them on the map.\n3. You get a quest to invite a survivor way before you're ready. Since you'e already met this person you immediately think, \"Oh I know what to do here!\" So now you're under the pressure to help the villagers in my starting quest AND try to make a basic functioning town with supplies. It puts more stress on the player and limits your starting area. You feel ultimately pushed to start your new town where the game wants you to. That's a huge difference from Medieval's \"do it when and where you want\" energy that we were all looking forward to.\n4. There is a huge lack of customization. One thing that was great was everything you could customize. Now there's no fast crafting so if I make bunch of something I end of having to just sit there and watch over and over and over....It's a big  time consuming flaw. You also can't adjust brightness.\n5. Hitting escape has always been a way to pause. Not anymore. Got a phone call while you were hunting the only deer in the entire area? Good luck finding it when you come back. Everything has been moving that whole time.\n6. Nothing is easy to find. You want to find a specific collectible or animal? Good luck. Easy access to lessons from the tab menu? Nope. Some piece of the game you spent years waiting for? Tragically no, just a shell of it.\n\nI get that it's early access, but the fan base has always been extremely vocal about the things that matter. And things like, a map you can't read due to art choices, should have never been an issue. Who checked all this before release?  After Wild West Dynasty you would think it would be a little more double checked.\n\nSuper disappointed and a real shame I chose this as my birthday gift. I would wait until this one is fine tuned, especially if you're coming from Medieval Dynasty.\nNote: I have a computer that runs the game itself well and don't have issues there.\n\nUpdate: Due do the developers making certain comments to me I'm now getting a refund instead of waiting, watching, and improving my review over time. Maybe you should stop using players as people that pay to be game testers. EA has gotten out of hand.\nAnimals not spawning is a real complaint, not having a map I can actually see is a real complaint, not having lessons available to look back on in a brand new game is a real complaint, and the screen not pausing ever is a real complaint. That is not, \" oh sorry EA get over it\"",

Hunting is a bit more realistic here. Some animals will attack, when encountered. But “marked areas” would be a suggestion. Don’t forget to visit our suggestions forum.\n3. You can do things when and where you want in Sengoku Dynasty, too. You’ll just need housing and food.\n4. Customization. You can customize and you can fast craft, just press F when selecting the item, you want to have crafted multiples of.\n5. This was suggested already by other users.\n6. Again, more realism. Once you have villagers they can search for specific things even if you haven’t found them before.\n\nAs mentioned in some of the above points, please do not hesitate to post suggestions on the respective forum. \nRead you there and thank you in advance!\n"

The current roadmap looks good and will definitely improve the game, it is playable right now, but can be a little frustrating do to the lack of any explanation of what certain symbols mean and the insane amount of resources required to build 1 building.  Every resource has to have its own storage building, which I feel is excessive and tier 1 and tier 2 houses have only enough space for 1 person (hopefully this will change in the future).  I haven't see much combat yet, and I'm not sure how much will actually be in the game, about all I've ran into is a couple bandits and a few really tough boars.  Not a lot of wildlife right now and no fishing yet, Deer and rabbits are really fast so its hard to kill them, boars will come right at you and kill you if your not ready, the animals are by far more dangerous than the bandits.  One thing I certainly want to point out is that this is not Medieval Dynasty or Wild West Dynasty, it is totally separate from both of them, some things are similar but that's about it.  Personally, from what I've already played and looking at the roadmap I feel comfortable giving this a thumbs up, I'm not sure if it will be as good as Medieval Dynasty or not but its already better than Wild West Dynasty.",

I built support buildings and no one wants to work. I don't understand why this game was released, even early access. It's not ready. I do like the concept and I am ready for it to work and play, but, really disappointed. Going on the shelf until it's fixed!!",

You can make them at the workbench in the Woodcutters Hut.\n\nThere are some NPCs that you will meet during the main quest and that you can ask to join your village, your friend Ako will likely be the first. Others can be encountered later, in the world.\n\nYour villagers can be assigned to workplaces once they have a house with a bed in your village (that is when they start counting as villagers). To work they will need all tools and materials provided in the right storage buildings, and a storage building where they can put what they produce. Production happens on season change, just like consumption does. This makes it easier for you to plan both. \n\nIf you have any more questions, please join us on the forum here on Steam or on our Discord. \n\nI would be happy to see you around and will do my best to assist. :)"

            "review": "Obviously at this stage of the game it has a ton of potential. I feel like there is a solid foundation for a great game in the next YEAR. It runs and looks incredible on my 3070ti. I didn't know much about this game but I am enjoying how peaceful it is. Initial gameplay notes for hopeful improvements are as follows:\n-The nights outlast the days and it is incredibly dark, the torch radius needs a buff or days need to last longer.\n-Rabbits and rocks are very hard to distinguish. Animals running are clunky and sometimes it's hard to line up an arrow or tell if it lands on your target. \n-Combat risk and reward is lacking. Appreciate that you can avoid it nearly entirely if you choose but more action is always good. \n-Fall damage is way too extreme and unrealistic\n-Climbing and grappling is seemingly impossible\n-There is NO auto run button, this a no brainer.\n-The only form of transportation in this game is changing your bed from your established towns and then axing yourself to respawn elsewhere. To get a 3rd town though is a grind so you'll be running everywhere at all times. The map itself is not big but it is time consuming transporting materials. \n-You cannot pin or zoom on the map, much needed because the map needs a bit more contrast with lettering and overall improved viewing ability. \n-Respawn timers on wild life/greenage is unkown. Most things seem to never respawn unless they are people and things you loot each season. Perhaps this permanence is intended i'm not sure. Shaping the environment is cool more tools are needed to develop your land.\n\n-Jobs and required time for employees needs to be stated. I've been completing a special project involving a mine for many \"seasons\" (up to 5 days each I think) and I have no idea when it will finish nor can I tell if progress is being made. This is directly tied to your character and story progression and the UI is lacking. \n\n-Because of the lack of content progression is very slow,I've been using the same tools using the same buildings with very minimal rewards it feels like. Inability to unlock much of any content through gameplay thus far.\n\nOverall it's a chill sim game you load into and figure it out and enjoy the process of incremental successes, if that's what you're into hopefully they'll continue to improve and bring more gameplay hours.",

The mechanics are also the same in almost every way. all that is good news.\nIf the same team worked on \"Wild West Dynasty\" along with Toplitz,   it most likely would have been much better at launch than the disappointing nearly unplayable mess it was then. and still has a VERY long way to go to be as good as this is now!\nOverall, This title is quite enjoyable, progressing the story to build a town,  no voice overs at least not yet... and the Dialog is very strange and makes no sense most of the time and so bad you dont weant to even read them after a having read only a few. The environment is beautifully done, the characters however ,..not so much, but not bad either. it Looks and plays like an EA game title. the Dialog is a bit ODD, hard to be immersed because of it, \nI strted over again after a Month and very little improvement as I can tell I still hold out High Hopes for this one, But in \"TODAYS\" gaming industry its difficult top havr Faith!\nIf your on the fence on this one, and you love this type of game I suggest going ahead and getting this while its price is lower knowing there is a good chance it will be every bit as good as M.D. if not even better by the years end.!\n\nUPDATE 11-28-23   I just wanted you out there to know, I believe my predictions are correct indeed.!\nThis game already is nearly as polished as Mid-evil Dnsty, and plays the same in almost every way in such a short time is amazing by todays measures anyway. Much quicker than MD at this stage in release. \nI still say it will surpass the quality level as well  eventually. Amazing Immersion to this great successor to MD! Well Done Devs and  absolutely Beautiful Environment and artwork BTW!\nI simply can not wait for more content and updates!\nTis is what real Colony -City Builder type gamers want and deserve, TY!

I was really stunned. Sometimes I really suffered up until that point. I can tell you. Like really really. The grind is real! But it's worth it. Here we go...\n\nThis game will eventually be superior to Medieval Dynasty. I'm almost certain of that.",

This is a job well done and I want to see that more often!\n\nWhile it is an Early Access game and some things are still missing/planned, I already found it very enjoyable and encountered no game breaking problems.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and so is the music. I really like the sounds as well. It shows somebody really cared and paid attention and that’s a really good sign to me.\n\nYou can already build a nice village and follow several quests, gather, craft, fight bandits and wild boars (those are mean!), recruit NPCs – and there is co-op! \n\nThe loading screen at the beginning can take a moment, but afterwards everything ran very stable and smooth for me. I had no crash and no noticeable frame drops. (I know some do, but for me that just wasn’t the case at all, and I don’t have a NASA PC. Maybe it’s an Unreal 5 thing?)\n\nI don’t know that much about Japanese history, but what is mentioned in the game makes me curious to learn more about the real events.\n\nAll in all, this already is a game I love and I’m far from done exploring all of it. On day two of early access! From a new developer, not AAA! This is not common. Or maybe more common here than for the big ones now? Go, show them!\n\nThe map is big as well and you can go everywhere. There are different villages with people to talk to and quests and different bioms.\n\nI can’t wait so see what more is to come! The roadmap looks promising!",

The game looks beautiful, it isn't overwhelming and has a nice feel to the farming, gathering and hunting. I think the system of giving your villagers jobs could be explained a little better, and the process made easier, but besides that the only other complaint I have is walking/running everywhere...I thought there was a fast travel but I haven't been able to find it yet. I wish there was a mount you could raise or something. If you are on the fence about this game because of the mixed reviews I would say just get it and try it out for yourself, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality of this early access game.",

            "review": "I want to start by saying that this is an Early Access game. Knowing that not all features are there yet goes a long way.\n\n\nSengoku Dynasty is a lot like Medieval Dynasty, in fact, they're essentially the same but, Medieval Dynasty has far more to offer right now. I prefer the setting of Sengoku Dynasty more, that said Sengoku Dynasty has some problems.\n\nAlthough everything is there that you'd expect mechanically - the way you build houses and how you gather materials is all good, however, the game feels empty, low quality, and cheap. What I mean when I say cheap is that the game feels rushed and lazy. I'm not saying any developer is lazy, I don't know them, but the way the game operates... It feels \"just enough\" but nothing more. The graphics vary greatly from sometimes looking awesome, then for whatever reason, everything looks incredibly flat and... old... The animations are far better than most Dynasty games rivaling Medieval, however, there is a very foul stench of Jank, it's hard to describe what I mean when I say this because the game isn't clunky.. but.. combat looks lame, especially the way animals attack you. I was attacked by a boar and it kind of just.. ran into me with no visual indication that it was doing damage to me other than my health bar just.. going away... The same thing happened with a bandit.\n \nThe visual clarity when it comes to fighting, is bad. It feels.. old... like 2005 old... It isn't a game about combat but let me SEE that an attack is coming. \n\nI don't know what else to write because I'm on the bus shipping out, however here is a list of my gripes, and when things settle down I'll elaborate more:\n\n- I like the game\n- The Combat Animations aren't well done\n- Stamina Blows\n- Tool Degradation for Iron tools is bad\n- The inability to repair your tools (This is up to the developer if they want you to craft new stuff instead of having a forever tool, though repairs with reduced max durability could be a thing?)\n- Lack of Character Customization\n- Weak tutorial (This is subjective, I like to learn by doing, but when I have questions, the game should HAVE a solution for me, that I can read or interact with)\n- It's hard to figure out if your workers are working, what they are producing, how much they made, and so on - Give me a Screen a the end of the season that says \"Shinji produced XX Logs\"\n- You can't zoom in and out on your map\n- First-person often clips your hat into your field of view\n- You can't put markers)\n- No fast travel (This is subjective, but if the distances are going to be this great, give me a mount, that I can tame or find or buy..)\n- No AutoRun/Walk\n- No Farming\n- No Animal Husbandry\n- Your villagers wander around but they look incredibly aimless\n- Every villager's face is muddy and poorly done (Im sorry artist, but.. you can do way better than this, I know you can, so do it, make it good, we want you to)\n- Eating food serves no purpose right now other than make sure your stamina doesn't come back at the pace of Butt\n- No need for water \n- No Voice acting (this is subjective)\n- Trading Economy feels awkward, 20 for Stone Pick Axe but also 20 for an iron pick axe?\n- Projects to level up your dynasty is more exhausting than fun.\n- There's a lot of busy work but, it feels pointless right now\n- ALLOW US TO PULL RESOURCES FROM OUR STORAGE DIRECTLY INTO THE WORKBENCH WHEN WE OPERATE THEM. WE DON'T LIVE IN 1999 ANYMORE WHERE WE HAVE TO PUT THE RESOURCES IN OUR POCKETS TO CRAFT AT A WORK BENCH, I GET IT, BUT IT'S ANNOYING, NO ONE LIKES IT, AND GOD FORBID SOMEONE HATES THE IDEA OF NOT DOING IT, MAKE IT A BUTTON \"PULL RESOURCES DIRECTLY FROM STORAGE? ON/OFF\"\n- Let us pick a body type when we start\n- A massive overhaul of the textures and lighting for the world is required for the game to look more modern.\n- Scaleable UI\n- Allow us to BulK Craft (If it is hated, make it a button)\n- Archery Sucks\n--\n\n\nI'm sure there are more annoyances that I think about when I play. I like Sengoku Dynasty. I think it's great. I sat down for 8 hours and played. I had a good time. It's not worth buying into YET. Unless you really wanna play a Japanese Themed Dynasty game, in which case, go ahead. But it's dry, Kind of lifeless and very empty.\n",

            "review": "I wanna start off with some pros and cons before I give my review.\n\nPros -\n-Village management doesn’t feel bad or too difficult though maybe too easy\n-Village management SEEMS to get more complex as your towns grow (Went from just food and water to food, water, heat and maintenance)\n- I LOVE that there are stations where I just load resources and wait for them to finish (Tanning)\n- I like multiple villages and it being a part of the game at its core (would love to see it expanded with trading between villages)\n- I like the special projects but they seem to be in a pretty basic state\n- I like that I can’t just plop down a new bell and have forty villages\n\nCons -\n- Performance is not the greatest, granted I’m playing on a 1080 and an i7-7700K with 32gb ram and managed to somehow squeeze out 30 - 50 frames on high and shadows on medium\n- AI is also pretty bad and animals and bandits hit you without you even realizing it\n- Resources supposedly don’t respawn which isn’t a massive problem at this stage in the game with how many tree and bushes there are\n- No mounts makes getting around the map pretty tedious and it’s not even the full size yet\n- The economy is bad, really bad actually, more than half the time traders don’t have enough to even buy a single set of clothes from you  much less any sort of crops when farming enters the pictures\n- Deer run funny\n- it feels cumbersome to manage villagers jobs right now but isn’t the worst thing in the world\n\nThat said, my very short worded review below\n————————————————————\n\nThe game is definitely in a decent spot for early access, it’s semi enjoyable to explore around and find build project as well as mines, there’s a couple of things that make me hesitant to recommend such as lack of respawning resources and no way to extend carry capacity (Backpacks or carts) as well as no mounts or farming, however, I know they’ll come in time as the game develops. \n\nThat being said, I do recommend the game even playing single player I have enjoyed every minute of every hour I’ve been playing.\n\n————————————————————\n\nSuggestions -\n- I would like to see carts, packs and satchels/pouches to extend our inventory\n- Please let us plant trees so we can lay our own forest around our villages\n- Trade caravans and trade “missions” making special trade goods/packs that can be sent on a caravan after excepting a trade mission from my next suggestion\n- Mail/letters, some way for us to receive radiant quest that ask for goods or services\n- Mounts and carts, pulled by hand or not, some way to carry large amounts of things across the valley\n- Late game building/Manor construction, I’m sure you guys have your own ideas for the game but walking in to the manor and seeing it made me want to build my own even if it’s a prefab or special project\n-I have a ton more suggestions but my last one for this list is a better way to build fences. Pieces are annoying and almost always end up with some for of a gap.\n————————————————————\n\nKeep up the good work devs, I’m having an absolute blast and look forward to hopping in with my friend and playing co-op.",

There will be limitations to your progress due to lack of content, system support or features that aren't yet implemented.\n\nBy having the right mindset when starting this game will help you understand why you get frustrated sometimes, and if you're not up for that sort of experience, I would urge you to wait until a later date and return to this game when development has come a bit further. \n\nHaving said that, I'm very pleased with my journey so far. I do have long loading times when starting up the game, even tho it's placed on a really fast M.2 drive. I see people complaining about poor fps ingame, but I haven't had any issues with that so far, and my rig isn't the fastest out there, I have a last gen I5 (10 core) and a 3060ti card, so I'm sure there are people out there with vastly superior machines. \n\nSo what about the game then? Well, I have enjoyed it a lot so far. Stunning graphics, somewhat funky animations (jumping around like a happy child looks a bit odd for a struggling refugee, lol). It needs tuning in terms of the amount of tools you go through during one day. On the game discord someone said that it right now is a \"deforestation sim\", which is spot on, because as you start building all the houses you need for different things, you basically cut down all the trees nearby. But the feeling is there. The story is hooking, and I want to continue. Build out my first village and see to it that I have happy workers, producing everything needed.\nI'm also looking forward on starting a second village, and I have already been out scouting the map for a good location. \n\nThe devs seem to be on top of things, listening to the problems that arise, and try to push out patches as they go. I think it's been a few out already these first days. I think the future looks bright for this game. \n\n",

The progression is nice with always something to do, at least in the first few hours (where I'm at).  The story is interesting and the feudal Japan world quite immersive and well rendered.

I've since upgraded my GPU and the Devs have updated the game multiple times, and since then it's become a great experience.\n\nI'm only about 15 hours into gameplay currently. But i'm enjoying every bit of it. \nThere is still content expected to release for further combat and Families, etc. With the 1.0 release announced just recently.\n\nThe landscape, movement, building etc is all very enjoyable. With additional Combat that feels very smooth and fluid. I will most likely update further as i play and complete more. \nBut as is, it's well worth the Early Access price.\n\nMy only wishes, are more audio at the moment. Some Professions don't seem to have audio when workers are there. I wouldn't mind hearing someone actually saw wood etc when at their stations. \n\nAnd lastly, i would love for the Japanese Cicada to be heard somewhere. As of right now, i can not hear it anywhere during the seasons. You'd often hear it in media or just in person and it has a warm relaxing effect at least for me. So it would be nice, but if the location of the territory doesn't make sense for it i understand. \n\n-\n\n16GB 1333MHz DDR3 \nSSD & Hybrid Drives\nAMD FX-8350 Eight Core\nAMD Radeon RX 7600",

            "review": "[h1]Preface[/h1]\nI wish I could make a mixed review, because while I really like this game, I can't recommend it to [b][u]everyone[/u][/b] [i]right now[/i].\n\nIf you got into Medieval Dynasty late, or never played Medieval Dynasty, and are expecting an Early Access game that's been through some patch cycles, this game isn't for you just yet. If you haven't played Medieval Dynasty yet, I would go play that game first and see if you enjoy this style of game before trying Sengoku Dynasty. There is a lot more to do in Medieval Dynasty right now, and you'll be able to get a better feel for the genre.\n\nI went ahead and bought this game because I really enjoyed the evolution over time that Medieval Dynasty experienced (and continues to experience) as an early access game, and I trusted that I would enjoy it just as much with Sengoku Dynasty. \n\nWith how much I use Medieval Dynasty as a reference point, I will be shortening it to MD from here-forth for brevity.\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\nThis game is gorgeous for first Early Access release. I mean, it's classic Japanese country. You would have to actively try to screw it up. It doesn't really seem to be terribly taxing on my GPU, but my CPU sure is getting a workout. I've noticed there seems to be some bugs with CPU threads getting stuck or over-allocated or something, as my CPU utilization will skyrocket until restarting the game, but these don't happen very often. I imagine both CPU related points will be addressed in optimization passes.\n\nI do wish that the HUD scaling was adjustable, as I think some of the HUD elements are a bit too big and intrusive; particularly the quest objective element and the item descriptions when targeting items in the world. The item descriptions themselves are very welcome when getting started, as they provide a lot of useful information about how to interact with the world, but as I get more experience with the game I imagine I'm going to want to be able to turn them off completely.\n\nThe weather effects are BEAUTIFUL. Rain and rain sounds stop when occluded by rocks. Lightning illiuminates the rain around it. The rain pitter patters on the ground look really nice.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nLet me start by saying the map is HUGE. I wish I had exact measurements to back up my claims, but it seems like the map is about twice as big as MD's map, at least.\n\nMost everything here is what you expect coming from MD. The game starts out as pure crafting survival until you start recruiting villagers, and then it becomes part crafting-survival and part civilization-management. Villagers can automate your daily tedium, but they have needs of their own, which you'll have to fulfill yourself until you can get more villagers to automate that for you too. \n\nA few things have changed from MD though:\n[list]\n[*]Seasons aren't hard-stuck on a 3 day rotation like they were in MD. If you don't like a season, or did everything you wanted to, you can skip to the next season after 2 days. If you have a lot to do, you can spend as long as 5 days in a season. I like this a lot.\n[*]Instead of producing and consuming products in real-time, like in MD, villagers instead consume and produce season by season. I really don't like this change as I don't see any impact from my villagers work until the next season. So far this is really my biggest complaint with the game. I'm hoping this is just temporary for the first Early Access release and that the real-time produce/consume mechanic will come back.\n[*]Weight is no longer a restricting factor for inventories, including storage sheds (which was the primary reason for upgrading storage building tech in MD). Now inventory slots are all that matters. I like this change, and I want to see it fleshed out more. Right now there isn't a way to increase the amount of storage slots in a building, only build a new building; but using the new building furniture grid system, there is a whole avenue available to natively upgrade building storage, either with more storage chests or better ones.\n[*]Villagers no longer have proficiency levels, instead their efficiency is based on the quality of their tools and (like MD) their happiness. I'm neutral on this. It's removed some of the RPG elements, but at the same time I found it really annoying to run around the MD map looking for a villager that just happened to have slightly above average skill in the profession I needed. Better tools in MD also only felt like a slight improvement (for villagers), in that it just meant they consumed less tools over time and freed up some production in the line. So in one way or another better tools mean better productivity in both games, but its just more apparent in Sengoku.\n[*]Villager needs can be adjusted like taxation rate in a Total War game. Right now there's only two levels of \"need taxation\", but you can allow your villagers to consume more food and drink in order to give them a happiness bonus. Another good mechanic that I'd like to see expanded on, particularly a setting that leaves your villagers disgruntled (rather than angry when they have no food/water), but consume supplies at a reduced rate.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Closing Thoughts[/b]\n\nThere were some things I wanted to address briefly before I finished that didn't really merit a whole bullet point (although I guess with small paragraphs in each bullet point they're not really bullet points anymore).\n\nThe new building furniture grid is awesome. I really like being able to instantly place things in an organized and measured way; but for the people who want to go full Skyrim-modded-housing, there needs to be a way to disable it when placing clutter items inside houses. There also needs to be a way to re-reference tutorials that have already poppped up. The little drum sound that plays every time I craft an item is really cool, because it blends in as part of the music, but I feel like at some point I'm going to want the ability to turn it off.\n\nThe shrines are awesome, and the whole folklore of the game is done really well. The boons given by the shrines are really helpful without being overpowering, and the offering items (so far) are simple enough to not be tedious. I love going and giving offerings to Inari.\n\nOverall there is a lot of love in this game, and the only reason I can't say 100% that you should buy it now is simply the fact that not everyone has the patience to watch an early access game grow from the start. Medieval Dynasty has been on a long road, and this game will be too, but it will be worth it. If you know what you're getting into, and you really really want to be in feudal Japan, then 1000% get this game.",

            "review": "Sorry I wanted to give this game a chance but it just seems very rough still.  The best way I can think of to describe the game is its like a turn based RPG, where you assign workers to complete tasks/ gather mats, and they only do this as a one time action after you 'end turn' and skip the rest of the season. Multiplayer seems rather limited because only the host can see the objectives, therefore the other players are left either asking the host for instructions on what to help build in the limited space you have to start, or to wander aimlessly looking for the 3-4 boars that are active at any one time across the map. Theres only one combat move with the spear, and one basic shot with the bow. Falling more than 3 feet almost kills you. I'm only several hours end but I can forsee endgame just having multiple cities with multiple people all making stuff fairly automated, but to what end? Theres no great and terrible enemy added in yet, and it doesnt seem like you can train warriors, so in that regard, having friends to play with you may help. All of the buildings are preset, but each one has some customization options once built. Other than decorations, a lot of the buildings only exist for one to two crafting stations, where you can add in duplicate storage box 'extensions' of your main boxes, to access them a little easier which is nice. Definitely something a lot more slow paced than Conan or Valheim. The map is also very small; you could explore the entire place in maybe 20-30 mins. Late game so far has just been making really slow and uneventful runs back and forth between 3 different cities while looking for people to join you. Theres only one character model which is male, and no character creation yet. They would need a lot of work and with the way early access games are these days, I dont hold out too much hope for this, even if they are successful in the beginning.",

Overall, more fighting options -- and peaceful solutions -- are planned. \n\nThe same is true for character customization (a female option is planned to be added during Early Access as well).\n\nWe have posted our detailled roadmap. Take a look! I think you might enjoy what we have planned. :)\n\nAll in all, suggestions are great and you have already made some here. We also collect them in the Steam sub forum for it and on our Discord. If more comes to mind, don't hesitate to share it. \n\nThank you and  have a wonderful weekend!"

Graphics are really pretty but optimization is needed as I see others having that problem, I didn't experience bad lag but noticed a drop in fps after awhile. For first day early access not bad, there has been enough content to keep me busy and I still have plenty to do, lots of similarities to medieval dynasty, but still its own unique thing, UI and controls were intuitive for me, simple skill trees, hoping to see more in terms of character development. I like how japanese spirituality is involved you can get buffs from shrines. Village management was easy to figure out, nice that you can have multiple villages I decided to restore the starting one. Looking forward to further development, especially farming thank you for your time!",

            "review": "This game have potential and it is awesome!\n\nThe graphic with Unreal Engine 5 is phenomenon! I am glad such engine was released in my lifetime. \nFor those who do not have a good graphics card or gaming rig, wait until the game is more optimized! Ray Tracing during the night is beautiful!\n\nAlright here are my points in what I notice that are pros and cons (but not game breaking):\n\nPros:\n- Graphic overhaul from Medieval Dynasty!\n- Switch between third person view and first freely (without needing a mod)\n- Chopping trees down is not as clunky as the old Medieval Dynasty where the guy swing and stop every 5 sec per swing\n- No FPS issue on my rig\n- No crash\n- The movement of the player character in third person view makes it looks like the Dev are focusing on \"Battles/ War\" in the future. I see a Dynasty Warriors, soul game character movement fluidity as if you can jump into combat with your spear or sword from sprinting.\n- The foliage! with my setup it's phenomenon!\n- The rain! looks real!\n\nCons: \n- When you gather grass or berries the feature to just hold \"E\" without having to release \"E\" and press E again to gather is making me concern I break my E key...If the Dev can implement that code in to make it easier for us to just hold E to continue gathering whatever resource that we are gathering in a clustered area\n- The torch looks good in third person but in first person the Dev need to either fix the camera so we can see our arm and make the torch light cover more surrounding in first person view because it still look like it's night time in first person view while holding a torch.\n- No torch shortcut that we do not need to attach to a number shortcut like Medieval Dynasty. As long as we have the torch in our inventory I like the that feature in Medieval Dynasty where as long as a torch is in our inventory we can just press F and we'll be able to pull out our torch.\n- when tool breaks and we currently are on the number shortcut of the tool that broke and crafted the similar tool, it does not auto-equip in place of the broken tool. I'd like to see that feature back like from Medieval Dynasty. It's pretty tedious opening inventory after crafting and then having to equip the tool again. Currently, I have to plan ahead and craft 2-3 tool so if my current tool breaks the extra one replaces it...which isn't bad but it takes inventory space...(THIS HAVE BEEN FIX WITH RECENT UPDATE)\n- The transfer button does not have a key to press to auto max all of the item you want to transfer...currently, you have to use your mouse to move the shader to the far right to indicate you want to move all of the item of that stack over...If the same concept like Medieval Dynasty is brought back it would make life a lot easier\n- The NPC AI needs a rework, when they move they look stiff especially when the path they are given is cut short and they turn around while their body is still pointed toward the location where they were walking toward before turning. Making them move naturally would make the game perfect in my opinion.\n- and I'm sure the Dev have more feature they are looking to add since this game is still Early Access but we can't get them fast enough so points deducted due to that (Keep em coming, and thanks for your hard work on bringing this game to life!)",

IE having to physically drag logs, instead of being able to fill my magical pockets with trees. All in all for an EA its good, the initial load in made me think my game crashed, so expect that.",

Nope. just crashes on start up again. just going for the refund now. I'll repurchase in a year or if I start to hear \"great things\" about this game. Being a Toplitz product though, I have my doubts. I was hoping to play a dynasty game with my friends. I'll wait for medieval dynasty to update to co-op.\n\nThey have a message at the bottom of the loading screen warning players that it may take several minute to load on slower machines. It also takes several minutes to load on faster machines too. Hmmm. Might not be the machines then.",

I'm at about 9 hours now, about 1 day after the start of early access and I have to say I expected way more issues. The game is already suprisingly well working, the graphics are beautiful and there is unexpected well story telling. I feel the game actually educates me on political challenges of the time in japan and about culture and believes. I love that.\nCompared to Medieval Dynasty, that started to try and get \"cool\" with its story after a while, it was funny but didn't really feel authentic. I hope Sengoku will keep their course and take the story and culture more seriously.\nJust to name a few understandble issues of an early access: there are still quite a few graphics (mainly ground textures) that reload pretty often, but I think it happens for the most in weather when the ground gets covered in puddles or snow and sometimes when you turn around you suddenly stand in texture-mush for a second, but it loads pretty fast. The initial loading time is pretty long, but I think thats also because of some already nice effects/shaders like water and light. And I had a few NPCs bugging through walls or flying around for a few seconds, but just minor stuff. But the NPCs still behave strange at times.\nThere is still not much in the ways of skill trees/perks and quests. One quest so far was buggy, as I could not deliver the needed items, even if I had them in inventory.\nAnd some animals are still prone to getting stuck at rocks and cliffs.\nBut all of these are absolutely no big issues after about 24 hours of early access. If you can accept a few bugs with a nice and even educational early access survival-rpg-town builder/manager game than your money is well invested.\nI'm looking forward to the developement.",

Valheim had it from Day 1 in testing stage, and they had a tiny team, the company that made this has made other dynasty games but this one looks like they took steps back and regressed. Its not just trees, its any resource nodes, grass, food, ect. every resource is Finite, so you will strip the limited land you have because theres invisible barriers up blocking a large chunk of the land.  \n\nYou are jesus on water: Can walk across the ocean\nYou cant hurt anyone except wild bandits\nLimited resources\nIm only saying No on recommend atm until they fix these simple issues.",

It's more the [b]younger sibling[/b] of it, some things are very similar, some are radically different.\n\nGathering, building, etc. is very similar.\nProducing and village management is not. \n\nSo if you just expect Medieval Dynasty in Japan, [i]you will be disappointed[/i]. Of course, Sengoku looks up to it's older brother for things that worked fine. But it also wants to do things different.\n\nVillage Management: You only have to make decisions end of season. All production happen on season change, not daily like in MD. \nSpecial Projects: There are locations where you need to put in some effort to build them, that does not help you except your dynasty legend level will grow.\n\nThere's also a lot not implemented right now. Your villagers don't improve, some quests are stuck / bugged. This is expected in early access.\n\nStill, I like the game. The music and ambience sounds are already great, weather can change within a season, the visuals are great - but so are the hardware requirements.\n\nIt is totally playable. The developers do updates quite quick. I already got a lot of hours of fun out of the game.\n\nIf you expect a polished dynasty game: Do not buy this. Let it rest on your wishlist for a few months.\nIf you want to be part of an early game experience: Go for it.\n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone. Watch a stream, wait for some reviews, then decide if it is something you'd like.\nI know [i]I[/i] like the game.\n",

YOU JUST DONT LIKE SURVIVAL GAMES. Idiots like this shouldnt be allowed to give a review.\n\nNext one down had 28 hours, yet you gave it thumbs down. These people they the gave for over a day of their lives and give it a negative review. pure idiots.",

The first hour of the game plays like a survival game, but once you get past the tutorial tier quests, the dynasty systems that fans of the franchise have come to know are all revealed. You can build reputations with people, build your own settlements, create jobs and industry, and automate commerce. The systems are all there, but it is definitely early access.\n\n The UI will likely need another pass as the way that it's organized is less functional than medieval dynasty. The animations are a bit clunky and hit and miss, and will likely be updated as future updates come out. I run this game on a 3090, so performance is not an issue for me, but the community has suggested there are issues there. \n\n Multiplayer - There is no character creator, so you are all the same player model, I hope this is looked into sooner rather than later. \nThere's no game chat, voice or text, makes it VERY hard to communicate in a cooperative game\nSynchronization seems to be decent for an early access title.\n\nTL;DR - The game has a really solid foundation, but LET IT COOK",

Tapping e 100 times is not a good feeling.\nDecrease stamina drain by 50%. Even with the perk that lowers stamina drain by tool usage by 20% it is still far too fast. Sprinting / tool usage drains stamina way too fast.\nIncrease thrown spear damage. 4 spears to kill a fox is insane.\n \n\nExcited to support the devs and continue the journey of feudal japan.",

            "review": "Disclaimer:\nEverything written in this review is just my opinion.\n\nIt is pretty much, what can be expected from a Day One EA Game. Everything seems rough around the edges and the performance is pretty bad.\n\nThe presentation of the baseline story, using a voice over in japanese and animated illustrations that resemble calligraphy, sets the mood right for the start.\nThe game itself has undubbed interactions, that provide \"choices\" in the dialouges (they are not really choices, just talking points).\nAnd i think that is, why the mood set by the intro, gets lost on me while actually playing. Immersion in an environment with people in it, relies a big part on the spoken language, and without that (apart from the visuals), the worlds setting is pretty inconsequential.\nIt doesn't matter much, if i build a japanese little house with a cooking fire and a futon in the middle of nowhere, or if build a small brick house with a stove and a bed in the middle of nowhere.\nI think what would have been helpful in making it feel more japanese, would be having it set near a bigger city (i know, that goes a bit against the idea of the premise) or having a landscape, that inhabits more well known landmarks, like the Fuji, even if it is just as a picture in the distance.\n\nFurthermore i find it odd, to set a game that is called SENGOKU Dynasty, on a remote Island or something, far away from all the turmoil, the Sengoku Period of japanese history is literally named after (Sengoku = \"fighting throughout the country\").\nI understand, constant raids on your village would be quite annoying, but maybe set it in another period that isn't far from the period you want to show in the game regarding culture/architecture/etc., and prevent this ambivalent feeling.\n\nThere is a lot of potential, but as of now, i can't recommend it, if you're looking for an immersive experience in a japanese setting.\nI guess Medieval Dynasty might be just as good in providing this kind of gameplay.\n\n\nTLDR: \nIt has potential, but isn't very immersive. The setting is inconsequential and the name is kinda misleading, because you play in a part of the country, where the Sengoku Period is nothing more than a story people tell each other.\nSo i can't recommend it as of now, if you're looking for an immersive experience.",

Of course, that means there are lots of content missing that we can only assume, its being planned out by the developers to be released slow and steady, so the quality doesnt suffer. One point that they could change are the obvious inspirations taken from their last game, Medieval Dynasty. It should be treated as a whole new game, not just an extension of the previous one. I can only hope that they are going to add more content, and change it where necessary. It is Sengoku Jidai after all, danger should be everywhere.

To learn how to make the workshops, you would have to do the main quests to unlock them, such as the Smithy. \n\nCons/Disappointments/Nitpicks: \nSome complaints I have are that, the game has long loading times. \nSo I would have to be a bit patient and there are frame drops sometimes. \n\nIs this worth full price?\nIMO, yes because I know the Devs are committed to making updates and making the game better, and i know that medieval dynasty had its issues when it first released.

Yes, like most early-access games, it needs optimisation. And of course there's loads of other early-access type bugs. But, well, it *is* early-access. And there's a hell of a lot of game ready to play compared to many EA titles. \n \nAlso, the price is a bargain, many publishers would've tried to squeeze at least £40 if not £60 for this much depth and content.",

Some of the UI and controls take a bit to get used to but it's not game breaking and can easily be fixed.\n\nA couple pros and cons beside the obvious high Unreal Engine 5 requirements and missing or unfinished features.\n\n+ Good looking Sengoku Period Japanese island.\n+ It's not an empty procedurally generated open world survival game, there are quests and friendly NPCs.\n+ Has four different seasons and you don't need to play 20 hours in real time to see them all.\n+ You can modify already built building or move them around without any hassle.\n\n- Stone tools are constantly breaking and buildings take a lot of resources early on when you're alone without villagers to help.\n- Villagers are not \"active\", you will get resources each seasons depending on what job you give them and not in real time or at least daily.\n- No free build, ( Like Valheim for example ) you can customise buildings and object in them but their size are fixed.\n- Only 4 player coop, considering at some point you can build more villages, a 10 or 20 player count would have been an amazing selling point.\n\nWould I keep playing if it was not in the Sengoku period? I'm not sure honestly but it's not the game's fault and it might change once the game is out of early access with more features and polish.",

If you like games that you can sink hours into and see real progress I'd suggest getting this game. It's repetitive  solo but super fun in coop with your friends.

Yes its an early access game but something about the game play and mechanics of the game is lackluster. I mean what can I say about a $20 game. I would recommend waiting for further updates before buying because trust me its going to stay in your library collecting dust till the devs make changes.",

It can get quite boring after awhile without any actions. AI factions with mindsets like mount and blade for example.\n\nGender system is great too as I would love to play as a female leader\n\nMaybe a way to choose your own path and not just be the *good guys*. I would love to participates in raids and killing innocent villagers while they send their fighters to retaliate against mine.\n\nThis would make a perfect M&B + Shogun total war game with survival building mechanics. Overall great work and hope to see these features implemented!",

And hey, it takes place in Feudal Japan!!!  The world, architecture and atmosphere are top notch.    The story and game elements need their final fleshing out, but as it stands, this is a superb game!  Wakarimaska?\n\nDon't worry about running out of trees, there are enough in this map to build several Eiffel towers!  Grab everything off the ground, craft craft craft!\n\nThis is the most fun I've had since I got my hands on Valheim!\n\nI can't wait to see the rest of the build, and perhaps the ability to build your village anywhere without depending on the missions to choose where you live.  \n\nGo buy this game now!

For being in the first day of early access it is very playable, graphics are very good, no lagging so far, and tons of content and mechanics that are exactly what I hoped they would be which is heartily impressive. Early access games aren't for everyone and for people who want a completed game with all of the content that was promised available, they should be staying away from early access titles. But for those who want to participate in the process of early access, this is a great title with all the bones to make it great and I am excited to see where this one goes!",

I'm really excited to see future updates to this game.\n\nUpdate(SPOILER ALERT): still a great game I am currently level 19 have 3 villages and have all but 3 production buildings built. I cant build the fisher hut, the paper shop, or the miners hut. Its rough not being able to get stone from the miners hut but I have all of the special projects done so far. I have a am excited for more updates so i can level up further and unlock the miners hut. not sure what I am missing currently but I hit a wall. I cant find anymore specal projects to level up. I need to be level 21 to get further but cant figure out how to level up further. I cant find anymore quest to do and they never seemed to gain me any levels. I only got levels from building special projects. I understand its still being updated but having the miners hut and the fishing hut waved in my face this whole time and not being able to unlock them is frustrating. Granted I do have 111 hours in the game at this point and have restarted from scratch after the first update.\n\nUPDATE TO MY UPDATE: I have restarted my game after reading some helpful hints here on steam im 156 hours into the game total I have reached level 21 have everything except the spiritual archway (cant remember what its called at the moment). \n\nThoughts: The game is amazing, it definitely needs some tweaks in areas but they have covered this a lot in the road map so I wont touch on things i think they will fix. I love the building it feels similar to medieval dynasty but still has its own feel. I do feel the villagers need to pull there wait more I have 13 and cant get all needs satisfied at the peak happiness levels.  I still feel I am doing to much to be able to explore and I haven't added the 14th in this new game because that's when the need for medicine comes in. I will need to add 3 villages on top of that so I can add debarked wood, a forager for just the yellow flowers (again to lazy to look up actual name... sorry not sorry but this is on my mind now and I want to type out my thoughts), and a stone mason. Which is what I'm contemplating doing now but (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) I want to add my fourth village on the random island with the cool hill and the 3rd  place of power in a cave. I cant wait to find out what that will do in the future. I don't find that the bonus from the max happiness is enough to justify toggling the switch when they stay 100% and still get all of the stuff that satisfy there needs. with 13 people I have all needs satisfied with out doing anything myself for them so I can focus on my other stuff like exploring and building. The game play is absolutely whatever you make of it. I enjoy this style of survival mixed with city building its the perfect game for me. This is basically the game I would make if I could code. I have really high hopes for this game and really enjoy what I am seeing so far. I am part of the discord.(mostly a lurker) I have also posted on the community page trying to help out and help myself out.  I feel confident in saying this game is going to be worth it.",

It needs a lot of optimization in graphics performance, I have a Ryzen 7 and an Nvidia 3070, and the CPU and GPU consumption is excessive for the graphic quality it presents (i can make a barbecue on it :P ). It is superior to Medieval Dinasty for sure, but it is not mindblowing, by 2023 standards. The use of Unreal Engine 5 is not an excuse, come on devs, you can do better. When optimized, I change the review to positive.\n\nA great plus, i can play with xbox controller good enough.",

Not everything is working perfectly yet but that is normal for an early access title.\nIt has more customization than Medieval Dynasty.  I have not journeyed far enough to see if they \"valley\" is as detailed Medieval Dynasty.  It definitely has that Japanese flavor that makes me want more.\nI have no doubt I will rival my 300+hours I spent in medieval dynasty.   So for an early review I say TWO THUMBS UP AND WAY TO GO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI Love this game so far and cannot wait to find more shrines and build more Sengoku Dynasty villages.\n",

It's not without its bugs and slight freezing but that could be my computer (3080 rog strix/5800x/32GB ram). \n\nBut so far i like the story, hope more of the story and features captivate me. I've put a measly 50 hours into MD on game pass. But this also has multiplayer so maybe i can play with someone or friends eventually (though i don't mind solo play). \n\nPlayed on both M&K and controller and I prefer controller but it is a bit clunky.\n\nEdit: I've noticed freezing happens more often when i try to bring up the crafting menu and close it accidentally. Then I'm stuck for a couple minutes waiting for the game \"un-freeze\". but the actual game doesn't actually freeze, its like the menu thinks its still up so time in the game is still passing but i can't actually do anything until the game realizes I don't have the menu open. also one of my quests is bugged i cant turn in the ingredients to one of the NPCs even though i have the required amount in my inventory and in my dynasty storage.",

I found the beginning odd where you could go and build wherever you wanted but then to unlock more buildings you had to go all the way back to a quest giver who at that stage was about 2000m away! Maybe they should have said we would need to talk to them again and I wouldn't have wandered off. It's pretty, but you spend most of your time looking at the floor. Your items break really easily, my attempt to chop a tree down by clicking with my axe often wouldn't work and I got physically stuck in a bamboo forest and couldn't walk through it easily. Oh, and you cannot swim, you just walk under water and have this weird green sheet above you. That ought to be sorted. I don't doubt that they will fix a lot of things, but right now just really not that fun I'm afraid. I find it hard work, the characters say they overthrew the lords and now it is called Peasant Kingdom, but I can tell you they were misled, the lords are now not people but your tools and trees and rocks and twigs and conifer logs, not deciduous ones, and straw and grass and...the life of a peasant has never felt so annoying...",

If it ends up with the same features as Medieval I'm certain it'll be the perfect Sengoku-era RPG for people that want a somewhat grounded survival/city builder hybrid.\n\nHowever, there are big issues you should be aware of:\n-Optimization. The CPU is put under too much load in general, and performance worsens if you idle for too long or if you enter a session right after leaving one. Restart your game every time you want to load a save to ensure good performance.\n-Some features you'd consider to be basic are missing. Chief among them is Farming, but the alternatives you have (Fishing, Foraging, Hunting) are enough for now. Very little late-game content.\n\nAnd smaller nitpicks:\n-No voice acting, although it doesn't bother me that much\n-Lots of running back-and-forth to complete the main quest line\n-Loading times are crazy\n-Alt-tabbing from fullscreen is weird sometimes\n-Other than the quests, you're given very little direction on what to do. Once a community wiki gets set up this won't be a problem but for now you gotta figure everything out yourself",

            "review": "Promising Early Access Experience with Room for Improvement\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nIn the ever-expanding realm of early access video games, the latest contender comes in the form of an open-world Japanese masterpiece that has the potential to captivate players seeking a blend of survival, construction, and cooperative gameplay. While still a work in progress, this game manages to impress with its depth and immersive qualities, although a few rough edges need polishing.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Expansive Open World Japan Setting: The game's open world, set in a beautifully rendered Japanese landscape, is a breathtaking feat. From serene cherry blossom-filled valleys to majestic mountain ranges, the attention to detail in recreating the environment is truly commendable. Exploring this virtual world feels like stepping into a traditional Japanese painting.\n\n2. Aesthetic Appeal: Visuals play a pivotal role in capturing players' attention, and this game does not disappoint. The picturesque scenery, combined with meticulous design of structures, characters, and even small details, contribute to an aesthetically pleasing experience that's hard to ignore.\n\n3. Engaging Survival Mechanics: Survival enthusiasts will find themselves right at home with the game's survival mechanics. Resource gathering, hunting, and crafting are seamlessly integrated, creating a dynamic and immersive survival experience. The constant need to maintain your character's well-being adds an engaging layer of challenge.\n\n4. Building Mechanics: The incorporation of building mechanics into the game adds another layer of creativity and strategic thinking. Constructing shelters, crafting stations, and fortifications feels intuitive and rewarding, enabling players to carve out their own niche in the world while enhancing their chances of survival.\n\n5. Combat and Co-op: The inclusion of combat, while still a work in progress, adds a satisfying element of action to the game. Engaging in skirmishes with both hostile creatures and potentially other players (in the cooperative mode) adds variety to the gameplay and makes every encounter a thrilling experience.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Lingering Bugs: As expected from an early access title, a few bugs and glitches are present. These issues can range from minor graphical hiccups to more significant gameplay disruptions. While these bugs are an understandable part of the development process, some players might find them frustrating.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis early access gem provides a sneak peek into the potential of what could become a landmark title in the survival-adventure genre. The meticulously crafted Japanese landscape, survival mechanics, building features, and promising combat mechanics make for an engaging experience that already stands strong despite its early state. With a development team dedicated to further enhancing the game and addressing its imperfections, players can eagerly anticipate a refined and polished final product. If you're a fan of open-world survival games with a Japanese twist, diving into this early access journey could be well worth your while.",

I love MD and I play it on PC and Console so that say a lot about how i feel about the game... This game looks great and i been wanting it since i say it was being made and so far i am enjoying it a lot. \n\nNow i do with the it had some quick slot so i dont have to keep going into my bag to get weapons and tools. Also i wish i could add food to the quick slot too that would be nice, the building stuff could be more stream line to make it easier to build stuff and a quick build and craft would be a nice add. \n\nthose are really my only Con i can see for now and i hope they work on them in the future and they make this game as great as Medieval Dynasty",

The game is beautiful, the quest are plentiful, and the game is an era not available with many other games. The franchise is great, only one of three games has major problems on launch. I think that is because of the game engine used by Wild West Dynasty. The unreal engine seems to work far better.",

People who play an Early Access game for 0.5 hours and then go to write a review are very very suspect, to say the least. \n\nNow, as for Sengoku Dynasty!\nSuperkami have absolutely done their homework. The game is firmly set in a background that takes you to Japan of the 16th century. The lore feels believable and in-game you find the same attention to detail. This is promising! \nAlso the fact that co-op is in the game from the start and is working mostly fine, that's also well done! \n\nI will continue to update this review as development progresses but I am absolutely hopeful so far. \n\nAt this point, I won't even go into detail of what's missing, bugs and lack of polishing. It's the first day of Early Access, keep that in mind. The game is playable, even though performance needs a lot of work, I've not had any crashes or gamebreaking bugs so far. \n\nI am excited by the premise of this game and I am willing to remain patient and follow the development!",

People are too harsh to judge sometimes but this is much better than the first version of Medieval dynasty and has more quality of life features https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV0lxpUpXxg\nPro: fast pick up and play, tutorial does a proper job, the inventory and management system is good, you really feel free to do what you want, big map to play around, good atmosphere and immersion, easy to build\nCons: looks like your average 2015 survival game, people complain there is no voice acting but i prefer it to having bad voice acting, some performance issues, building UI should have much better icons\nI think this way better than Medieval dynasty early access where i needed to play 10 hours just to get started. The quests and story maintain progress and you can see they wanted this game to be much faster than medieval dynasty when it comes to acomplishing tasks",

I have not experienced any crashes but i am now trying to build my bed and fireplace which the areas are highlighted but when i start trying to build there i am told can not place structure here even though that is the highlighted area. I seriously can not recommend it unless you run on lower settings and even then i am not sure older hardware would run this that great. To make matters worse the guides have to be bouight with real money, like what kind of greedy scheme is that that guides cost extra money?? Skip the game unless you can pay under 10 for it and do not mind no guide being available.",

            "review": "This is an early review, because I felt so far, the reviews have been lacking. It's very similar to Medieval Dynasty with some changes. Firstly you get points as you progress to add to perks. So you can choose to be better at whatever skill path you want even if you've not been using it. Secondly, the graphics are very well done. I was expecting this for the terrain from the previews, but I found the characters are better textured than I was expecting. It is genuinely a visual pleasure to explore the world. Thirdly, the setting is well done. My wife is from Asia, mixed Asian heritage; her mother is from Japan, so cultural appreciation and sensitivities are important to me. So far, so good. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with the franchise. These games focus on mild survival elements, more about bonuses than negatives. The crafting and building elements focus on village creation, not building everything piece by piece, but block construction with added customization. Building reputation to expand your construction opportunities and NPC interaction. Hunting and fighting are secondary considerations, but I'm hopeful this game expands more that direction. We'll see. \n\nAs for the small minded review about voice acting: 1. Normal for this franchise. 2. The Intro is voice acted, in Japanese, and very well done. 3. It's early release; this may be added. 4. Go play Baldur's Gate.  \n\nSmall edit. There are some aspects that are still rough. Some game mechanics that are not intuitive. I still gives this a positive review overall, but if you are easily frustrated with games that are not polished yet, you may wish to purchase at a later date, or purchase to support and play later. \n\nI will try to add more to this review after further exploring the game, but much of it seems like Medieval Dynasty with much needed improvements (BTW, I harshly review other games in this franchise, I'm not just a fanboy; it is genuinely well done and fun...so far)",

Also Idk if it's possible but have NPCs to help builidng our blueprints would be also great, like giving orders to NPCs... Overall it's the first phase of the game, is cheap and yeah I recomend this game, keep it up!",

Yeah, some items are missing - like farming, but it's on the roadmap to come. \n\nA lot of people are always looking for a new/different \"Medieval Dynasty\" type game. I was there Day 1 of Medieval Dynasty and it was rough around the edges. They polished and honed that game into perfection over time. \n\nI see the Developers doing that with this game. They have put a lot of TLC into things like sound, environment, etc. They already have co-op, as well as the ability to change between first and third person view. Not even MD had that in the beginning. \n\nThis game is different, but similar. On the plus side, some things are the same - Q for crafting basic tools, F for crafting multiples of an item. The downside is they forget to tell you that. So if you didn't play MD, you might not know that at first. \n\nThere are some basic QOL things I'd like them to add/change. Like - they don't have an inventory sort. I'd like that to be added. And strangely, it seems like your most recent save is at the bottom of the list instead of the top. I'd like that to be reversed. But these are small things.\n\nIn general, the game is very playable. I haven't had any problems with bugs or crashes yet (crosses fingers). If you are new to the genre, give it a try!\n",

I'm at a loss of why people are complaining about it as it's been out for literally hours, so nobody has had time to dig into the later-game stuff yet.  \n\nI think it's very promising, especially for a developer that looks like they just started out and this is their first game (SuperKami, if you can't read)",

I haven't unlocked everything yet while being ~15 hours in. I expect to hit around 20 hours before I have unlocked everything, and then I still would spend more time designing my village the way I want to.\n\nOverall, I'm quite satisfied, and I hope that the devs manage to implement the plans from their roadmap over the next few months.",

            "review": "First of all, I would like to thank the development team. The game idea of this as well as its predecessor \"medieval dynasty\" is exactly what I want from a game. \n\nAs in its predecessor, it is a beautiful world with many small details. It would be a nice feature if there were voice actors, but that's also something that fades into the background with the advancing story. Unfortunately, what destroyed the atmosphere of the game was that I built my first settlement next to a lake. You can't swim in this lake, but walk through the lake under the water like pirates of the carribean.\nI would like to see a bug fix for this or tentacles like david jones.\n\nThanks to the music and the shrines, which are an important part of Japanese culture and were implemented with beautiful pictures, the game atmosphere was quickly back and I fell straight into a panic attack for fear of robbers, a samurai uprising, or that a Portuguese ship would annex my entire village and that I have to proclaim the Japanese isolation myself.\n\nHowever, the 'multi-village' idea is perfect and provides the player with a lot of fun. I can only say a good idea, just as you imagined it, implemented and runs flawlessly. terrific. now I'm overwhelmed with 2 cities and there are even more starvation deaths :)\n\nBug or feature ? Unfortunately, my PC should be able to play this game easily, but there are a few performance problems where you end up below 60 FPS and you also get to feel these problems.  however, if it's a feature, it unfortunately doesn't bring back the old days of gaming when 30 fps was normal\n\nI will definitely continue to play the game because the combination of good intro, nice atmosphere through music and beautiful scenery as well as the interest in Japan captivated me. In my opinion, the construction system is also optimal and error-free for my conditions.\n...\nthe fact that I tried to slaughter everyone is irrelevant here.",

            "review": "This game is pretty awesome. But before we go into why, let's go into it's problems.\n\nIt has some serious issues with stability. It freezes, it drops frames, it has glitches and clipping issues, and don't even get me started on its online co-op connection issues. But it also has a really badly designed co-op system. As far as I know, while playing there is no way to view the server password that the game gives you. So there's no way to invite your friends to your game. Even the steam overlay doesn't work. You have to take a picture of their randomly generated server password and send it to your friends or else you won't be able to have them join you. There's literally no other way to my knowledge at this point in time.\n\nOkay with that out of the way, everything else about this game is fun, engaging, intuitive, unique and overall fairly well designed. The building mechanic works and feels good, as does the survival aspects of the game.\n\nThe simple fact that you can play this together with friends and work together to accomplish objectives and build multiple villages is pretty awesome as well. The sounds are really nice as is the music, the gameplay loop is engaging and fun and when you consider how much this game offers overall, that pricetag is pretty decent as well. So yeah, I think it's worth it, despite it's bugs and glitches. Even for being an early access game I think this is a pretty safe investment.\n\nBut if you'd like more detail with gameplay footage then please check out my video on my YouTube Channel (link below).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12D-rTWrhCE\n\nOtherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.",

When creating a new game, I assumed I would get a character creation screen but didn't see any.  Instead I am stuck playing a man with no character customization.\n2. When I got to a point where I need to craft a tool. I couldn't figure out how to. There is nothing telling you how to do this. I went to the menu and didn't see any 'Craft' menu items. I went to my Inventory and don't see any 'Craft' buttons. I am totally confused on how to craft anything at this point.  i\"m stuck.\n\nI'll change my 'Not Recommended' to 'Recommended' review once I figure this out =) ... \n\nOkay I figured it out. To do basic Crafting you have to go to a separate menu by holding down a hotkey. For PC it's 'Q' by default.\n\nI definitely think the interface could use some improvement in terms of combining actions, streamlining items so they are in one place instead of having to click through a hierarchy of menus, and instead of having a 'Q' radial menu just create a separate menu section next to inventory. Also, I would like to see my toolbar slots in the UI displayed...maybe there's an option, i need to look into it =D\n\nBeautiful Game so far in terms of environment =D",

The negative reviews seem to forget that this is an early access game and that medieval dynasty basically was full of flaws, ugly UI elements and bugs too, but ended up becoming pretty good due to the efforts of the developers.\n\nThings that however need to be expanded upon. UI is kind of bland: It should be reworked for a more pleasant appearance. Also mention in tutorial that there is a item wheel. If possible, add some voice acting. \n\nA feature I would like to see is that tools can be repaired and that item slots can be saved so that when your ax breaks and you make another one that it will reappear in the item slot that it was added to.",

            "review": "So I haven't played many early access games, but I liked the look of this one and loved Medieval Dynasty so I copped it.\n\nSo from what little I've played I'll go through the good first:\n1. The setting. Big fan of Japanese culture and this game has the potentially to put you in a semi-fictional version of the Sengoku period.\n2. What I'm calling the 'multi-village' idea: the idea that you can manage multiple villages. In MD you just make one big village and that's basically it.\n3. The music is really cool. However I can see this getting the same issue that MD had in the way that there seem like there are too few tracks. I often turn a spotify playlist on when I played MD because the music, though excellent, did get repetitive.\n\nNow for what isn't so good. But please bear in mind I'm literally playing this on day 1 of early access:\n1. Frame rate is an issue. My PC isn't a spaceship or anything but should 100% play this game at max settings with no issues. Though it's worth saying that while the frame rate is low, it is consistent, so if you can handle that kind of thing you can take solace in the fact that it still has the first 's' in 'frames per second'.\n2. This could be an intentional choice but to me the stone tools break a little too early to seem fair. I'm sure this alleviates itself later on in the game when you get better tools.\n2.1. As a result of the above issue, you have to keep opening your bag to put new tools in if you only have 1 in your inventory. A good QOL improvement could be that they auto-equip when you've crafted another as I can imagine this would get very annoying.\n3. By far the biggest issue for me is the textures. Like I say my PC should run this on max with no issues but some of the textures, particularly on the ground and on the houses, are very distracting and changing the texture settings doesn't seem to do anything for me. \n\nOverall this game has the potential to be just as good as MD, but we'll gave to see how early access develops over the next year or so.",

Bought because of Medieval Dynasty and Starsand, both Topiltz games. and both very excellent games. Starsand is REAL survival game. Now this game I like that you can climb (up at least) and how that anything that you build can be moved, haven't tried moving a house while actually being populated yet, but fences, posts and storage builds with stuff in them can all be moved (pretty cool!). And yes the story is similar to Medieval Dynasty, the secret, it's in the name: DYNASTY. Since it came out there has been multiple patches fixing some of the bugs, and they are still working on it. The only real problem I have is my I-7 2600 cpu spikes along with my 16gb of ram, causing some movement glitches and a increased loading time on the save file. Definitely well worth it, lots to do!!

            "review": "For an early access release, this game is surprisingly in-depth.  There is plenty of content to keep players happy while the development team works to implement all aspects of the game that remain to be added.  This isn't a 5 minutes and your done demo, this is a 'dinner's 5 hours late but I just need 5 more minutes\" game that will keep you engaged with it's beautiful views, impressive content, and easy to understand game play.  Yes, it's early access so it isn't complete but what's there will wow you.\nEdit 12/11/2023  Wow. What a difference a few months make.  I look back on some of these negative reviews and hope they all come back and see how wrong they were.\nIs the game complete yet?  Nope.  Far from it.  But updates have been timely and steady.  More importantly, they've all been incredibly impactful to game play.  The game is smoother (but by no means optimized), there's a ton of fixes, balance changes, and actual content added.  The farming system was introduced and, with the exception of a small bug on launch, now works incredibly well.\nSuperkami has met, exceeded, then blown away my expectations.\nStill, Early Access is not for everyone.  Me, I hate early access.  It's one of my blocked tags.  The fact there are things hinted at in an EA but not delivered until the roadmap says so drives me up the wall.  And there's the whole 'will they even bother finishing or is this just a cash-grab-and-split title\" that all EA gamers end up asking.\nSengoku Dynasty isn't done.  It bears repeating.  There's a lot there and quite a few \"hinted\" things that I find annoying.  But, I still find enough enjoyment in just what is already in the game to have kept me occupied for 451 hours.  Yeah, I burned out a bit and had to take a 6-week vacation but still, I'm back at it and the game stuck in my head all during that time.  That's telling for a game that's still half a year or more away from actual release!\nIf you like survival crafting, give it a try.  Offer up your observations and suggestions and help shape what is already a great game into something truly legendary!\nUpdate: 5/08/2024  Several new updates have radically changed the game for the better.  More control, more population, more buildings, new designs, so many wonderful additions, many of which came about from player input.  It's still not complete (far from it) but the promise of the constant updates, hotfixes, and dev interaction on Discord and Steam keeps this title in my favorites list.\nUpdate for 1.0:\nHo-ly CRAP!\nFrom amazing to UTTERLY FANTASTIC in one update.  So many changes, so many improvements!\nSure, I hate the combat but that's a personal preference.  But the game just got a hot shot of absolute creative genuis.  Regional conflicts and conquest, new buildings, more and varied items, new ways to meet Needs, new areas of the map to explore, exploit, and build on.  New character creation including the long-requested female character.  I just can't say enough positive things about the game.  It still isn't perfect but we've already got one hotfix and one update since 1.0 and it's been less than a week.  There's still a long road ahead for this game's development so if you haven't bought this game yet but have been sitting on the fence, get down off that perch and get the game.  The most common complaint I've seen in the very active discord serves is that the game is \"too addicting\" and \"I can't turn it off yet, I've got so much more to do.\"\n\nI'd say those are some pretty awesome complaints, wouldn't you?",

(Update)\nNo hate towards the developers what so ever! \nI like the concept but it lacks a lot even for early access.\nGraphics are nice, runs quite well for an early access game however, character movement is a bit clunky.\nI know this game will get better with time! This is why I have written a list of what I think could really improve gameplay.\nMainly because I want to see this game so well!\n\nThese are the things that are bugging me already.\n\n1. No Voice Actors? No voices? Makes the game boring and feels like I am talking to walls... Would help to give the npc's a bit of character? Why not add in voices???\n\n2. When handcrafting a weapon, why do I have to constantly go into my bag to then place it into the inventory? There is a huge amount of slots, why doesn't it just replace the place of which my last tool broke?\n\n3. There is no real guidance with the building, it tells you to build something then you have to rummage through the build menu to find what you have to build.\n\n4. a quick build option would be nice, like what they have in med dynasty, no one wants to wait five minutes to build a house.\n\n5. Bland & Boring, you find the music repetitive along the interactions. Not much in terms of engagement? Storms? Bad weather? \n\n6. No option to steal off other villages and do little rpg touches, alongside pretty much no leveling system. \n\nI will be back to continue to add to this....",
